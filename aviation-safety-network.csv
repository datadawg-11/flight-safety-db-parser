Flight 154 reported over the Aurora Intersection at 07:03, and a few minutes later the captain requested a clearance to return to Omaha. This clearance was granted. Seven minutes later, at 07:10, while en route to Omaha the company issued the flight revised instructions to proceed to Kansas City. While en route to Kansas City, the company's Kansas city dispatcher informed the flight that if they returned to Chicago immediately, an approach clearance could be obtained without delay. Accordingly, the flight returned to Chicago and upon arrival there approach control cleared it to make an ILS approach and to land on runway 13R. At this time the Chicago weather was reported: ceiling 300 feet, visibility 1-1/2 miles with moderate fog and smoke, and wind west-southwest at 8 mph. The ILS approach was abandoned at the captains discretion and he started another.

Since the airline wanted to use the aircraft to open their service between Sydney, Australia and Honolulu, Hawaii on April 28th 1953, it was to be flown to Sydney.The flight crew had completed a Comet jet conversion training in the U.K. and were still inexperienced in operating the Comet when they departed for the ferry flight to Australia. Neither of the pilots had experienced a night takeoff in the jet, nor had they flown it heavily loaded.  The takeoff from Karachi would be the first night time takeoff.During takeoff, while accellerating past a speed of 85 knots, the pilot raised the nose wheel. He should have levelled the plane until the nose wheel was just off the runway. Instead he continued to roll nose-high. In this position wing drag increased, causing a slower than needed acceleration. Nearing the end of the runway, the pilot brought the nose down but the remaining runway length was insufficient to reach rotation speed.The aircraft ran off the end of the runway and a wheel on the starboard undercarriage struck the culvert of a perimeter drainage ditch. The Comet swerved and plunged into a dry canal. At a speed of more than 138 mph, the Comet impacted the forty-foot embankment on the far side of the canal.

On the return flight a refueling stop was made at Munich-Riem. The Ambassador arrived there at 14:17 in snowy weather. At 15:20 the crew received clearance to taxi to runway 25. At 15:31 the aircraft started the takeoff roll. An uneven engine tone and fluctuating pressure caused the crew to abandon the takeoff. The aircraft backtracked and was cleared for a second attempt. This time the no. 1 engine pressure rose, causing the crew to abandon this takeoff attempt as well. The aircraft taxied back to the tarmac and the crew discussed the problem. It was decided that opening the throttles more slowly, could eliminate the problem of 'boost surging'. Although fresh snow was falling, most of it was thought to have been blown off by the first two attempts to take off. Also, the few centimeters of slush and snow on the runway were not considered a problem by the airport authorities at the time. Around 16:00 the aircraft was again cleared to taxi to and takeoff from runway 25. Accelerating through 85 knots into the takeoff the no. 1 engine surged slightly. The no. 1 engine was throttled down until the surging stopped; power was then applied slowly again. The nose was lifted as the Ambassador accelerated. At 117 knots V1 was called. Before reaching V2 (119 kts) the aircraft entered an area of even slush. The airspeed dropped to about 105 knots, an speed insufficient to become airborne. Also, there was not enough runway length available to stop. The Ambassador ran off the runway and crashed through a boundary fence. After crossing a small road, the aircraft slammed into a house and a tree. The plane skidded another 100yds until striking a wooden garage containing a truck.

Ten crew and 122 passengers were on the flight when, after a considerable delay to await the arrival of passengers, it was cleared to take off from runway 08 at Orly Airport at 11:32 UTC. It aligned itself for takeoff and waited 6 seconds, which permitted the setting and checking of takeoff parameters on the four engines. Full thrust was applied, and the aircraft accelerated normally. From testimony and flight recorder data, the takeoff was reconstructed as follows. Between 20 to 40 seconds after the start of the roll, the rate of acceleration was steady at 1.80 m/s2. The aircraft rolled along the runway centre line without showing any tendency to veer to either side. V1, determined as 147 kt IAS, was attained after a ground roll of 1500 m. This was followed by VR, 158 kt IAS. Forty-eight seconds after the beginning of the takeoff run and approximately when passing the 1800 m mark, the aircraft reached the rotation speed (VR), and the pilot-in-command initiated the takeoff manoeuvre by pulling backwards on the control column. According to witnesses, the aircraft made an incomplete rotational movement about 2100 m from the threshold. It remained for 4 to 6 seconds with its nose slightly raised. Then the nose dropped when the brakes were applied. Thick smoke streamed from the wheels. The aircraft was 2600 m from its starting point and had reached a maximum speed of 179 kt IAS. It braked for the last 680 m of the runway with an average deceleration of 1.2 to 1.3 m/s After 250 m of braking the aircraft veered slightly to the left, and 50deg of flap were selected. Then after another 250 m the aircraft listed heavily to starboard. Its path then curved right, which suggests a possible attempt to ground loop. However, the aircraft's speed precluded the success of this manoeuvre, and it left the runway while still on the centre line. It rolled for a while on the grass extension of the runway but, because of the unevenness of the terrain and the high speed of the aircraft (160 kt), the port gear broke off 110 m from the end of the runway and was wrenched away. The aircraft pivoted left, and engines No. 1 and 2 scraped the ground. Fire broke out in the port wing at the level of the landing gear. About 300 m beyond the end of the runway the aircraft crossed the encircling road. The starboard gear collapsed, and No. 2 engine broke loose. It then struck the approach lights, which represented a considerable obstacle. It started to disintegrate when reaching the hollow at the end of the runway extension, which descends at a steep angle towards the Seine. The front part of the fuselage struck a house and garage. The nose of the aircraft broke away, and the rest of the fuselage came to a stop 100 m further on. The site of the accident was 550 m beyond the end of runway 08 on its extended centre line, at an elevation of 89 m.",11:34 UTC,4 Pratt & Whitney JT4A-9,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),89 m (292 feet) amsl,AF007,4491,,,,,,

It arrived at Galeao Airport following an uneventful flight. Another crew took over for the last segment of the flight. The takeoff run began at 2303 hours GMT from runway 14. The aircraft's acceleration appeared to be normal. The pilot-in-command declared that, at a speed between 100 and 135 kt (V1), he noted that the control column was too far back and pushed it forward. At this point the co-pilot released the controls, which is normally done when the aircraft reaches V1. It is believed that in fact an attempt to rotate the aircraft was made around 132 kt. The aircraft continued to accelerate normally. The co-pilot announced 148 kt, the rotation speed (VR), and the pilot pulled back on the control column. However, the aircraft did not respond, so he pushed it forward again. No indication of this rotation attempt was revealed by the flight recorder reading. He and the co-pilot then pulled back on the control column, however, the nose of the aircraft did not rotate since the pilot had already reduced power 14 seconds after reaching VR. Also, the tape reading indicated that the brakes were used for 5 seconds prior to any power reduction. The first marks of braking were found approximately 2300 m from the threshold. The pilot realized that the aircraft could not be stopped on the remaining portion of the runway so he turned the aircraft off the runway to the right and fully reduced power. The brakes were applied but not reverse thrust. Heavy and steady braking marks started 2600 m from the threshold. Of his own accord, the co-pilot applied full power for reversion and tried to operate the spoilers but could not do so because of the bumps The right wing lowered, dragging engines No. 3 and 4. The left wheels of the landinggear sank into the sand, and engines No. 1 and 2 also began to drag. All four engines lost their ejectors and reversion cones, causing the aircraft to accelerate. It continued moving at a high speed, hit the airport wall, crossed the adjoining highway, lost engines No. 1 and 2 and the left landing gear and finally came to rest in the sea. 50 m from shore. It drifted 100 m while floating and then sank to a depth of 8 m. There were no lights on board the aircraft when it came to a stop as the automatic emergency lighting system did not function. One cabin attendant used one of the two flashlights available. The darkness increased the panic and confusion. The passengers could not use the main door as an exit because it would open into the sea. They did not know where the emergency exits were. However, the exits were then opened and most of the passengers left the aircraft on the starboard side. The fact that the lour exits were all in the central part of the fuselage hampered the evacuation as the number of passengers (94) was considerable. The crew left the aircraft via the cockpit windows. No instructions had been given on emergency procedures and therefore the passengers and most of the crew did not take their life jackets with them when leaving the aircraft. Although the aircraft was equipped with six life rafts. no crew member tried to use them.

After making three circuits of the aerodrome, the captain decided - from his own in-flight observation of the aerodrome lights - that the visibility was adequate for an approach and landing on runway 10. During the final approach some of the runway lights became obscured and, on crossing the runway threshold, the aircraft entered a shallow layer of fog. As the aircraft was flared for landing, the captain switched on the landing lights. The reflection of these lights in the fog dazzled both pilots, causing them to lose visual reference.

During the flight to Leeds/Bradford, the crew received the 07:50 GMT weather report for Leeds, which indicated visibility 1200 metres and 8/8 cloud at 100 ft., in rain. This report was confirmed shortly before arrival over the aerodrome, when Leeds/Bradford ATC passed the current weather report as follows: wind at 070°/10-12 kts; visibility 4 kms, but subject to rapid fluctuations down to about 1200 metres; 8/8 cloud, base between 100 and 200 ft. The captain decided to land on runway 33, which afforded the longest available landing distance (3,650 ft.), and was equipped with approach lighting and a VASI installation. At about 08:45 GMT, shortly after passing over the Leeds/Bradford NDB, the pilot was informed that the cloud base, measured by balloon, was 200 ft., and he was then cleared to commence a PPI continuous-descent approach to runway 33.On final approach, the aircraft broke cloud at a height of about 250 ft., and the approach was continued by visual reference.Following a normal touchdown at a point about mid way between the threshold and the intersection with runway 01/19, the pilotsfound that application of the wheel brakes had no appreciable effect. On realising that the aircraft would not stop before reachingthe runway end, the captain initiated a swing to the left, in order to avoid workmen on the runway extension. The aircraft ran offthe runway onto rough ground, and then bounced a distance of about 95 ft. before landing heavily on a mound of earth. This causedboth main landing gears to collapse.Examination of the aircraft showed that the wheel brakes were capable of developing the required braking power at the time ofthe accident. Both main tyres showed signs of scuffing and thin blistering, and the tracks at the tyres on the runway werediscernible as whitish discolorations. The depth of water standing on the runway in the vicinity of the tyre marks was subsequentlyfound to vary between 0.05 and 0.20 inches.

He was also advised that snow bad fallen, but that runway 33 had been cleared to a width of 30 metres, leaving snowbanks on either side, some 12 to 15 inches in height, and that a recent check on the runway surface had shown braking action to be ""Good "". On receipt of this information, the pilot decided that he would make a radar approach to runway 33, accepting a tail-wind component of about 5 kts. (No radar letdown procedure was available for runway 15 because of work being done to extend the runway). During the approach, intermittent sight of the ground was obtained from 600/700 ft. and continuous visual reference was established at 250 ft. At about four miles, the pilot re-checked that the tailwind component was still acceptable and, when he was able to see all the approach and runway lights, selected full flap. After touch-down, the aircraft drifted, or slid, to port, and the pilot was unable to correct this movement before the port wheels struck the bank of snow at the side of the cleared runway. The pilot reported that he found braking action to be poor and that he was unable to get the aircraft back on to the centre line before the nosewheels also struck the snowbank. The pilot brought the aircraft to a standstill on the runway, some 900 metres from the 33 threshold, and was able to taxi to the apron.

The reported weather over destination was above company's minima. After reporting 1500 ft, overhead VOR Bhubaneswar, the pilot joined the holding pattern. After holding for about 4 to 5 minutes for proper orientation, the pilot commenced let-down. While the aircraft was on in-bound heading descending, it broke cloud at 700 ft in moderate continuous rain and also simultaneously sighted the runway. Since the aircraft was not in line with the runway, the captain did a zigzag approach primarily for aligning with the runway.The aircraft crossed the runway threshold at a height of about 50 ft and the indicated airspeed was about 85 kt. Full flaps had been selected before the threshold, and the same had been selected 'up' when the nose wheel had touched the ground and the propeller ground fine pitch selected.The aircraft made a normal touchdown 38 ft to the right of the centre line of the runway and 1800 ft from the 05 threshold of the 4150 ft runway. The pilot stated that, after touchdown and little run, he experienced sudden heavy shower sweeping past the airfield, which had deteriorated the visibility very much. However, the direction of the aircraft was maintained straight. Towards the end of the landing run, the pilot felt that there was very little braking effect. Realising this, the pilot tried to swerve the aircraft to the right near the threshold of runway 23, with the idea of keeping the aircraft on the dumb-bell .

A Check captain joined the flight. The co-pilot was flying the aircraft from the left-hand seat whilst the pilot-in-command occupied the right-hand seat to assess his performance. The Check captain occupied the jump seat behind the co-pilot from where he could monitor the performance of both pilots.At 10:31 the aircraft commenced to taxi out for takeoff on runway 13. A wind check of 010/10 kt was passed by the tower and acknowledged by the aircraft when the takeoff clearance was given.At 10:34 a rolling takeoff was commenced. The co-pilot, who was piloting the aircraft, increased the power to 1.5 EPR after which the engineer set the engines at maximum power. The aircraft accelerated normally but at a speed of slightly under 120 kt (as reported by the co-pilot) heavy vibration was experienced. The vibration increased in severity and the co-pilot decided to discontinue the takeoff. He called ""abort"", closed the power levers, applied maximum symmetrical braking and selected the spoilers. The abort action was stated to have been taken promptly except that there was a delay of 4-5 sec in applying reverse thrust which was then used at full power throughout the remainder of the aircraft's travel. No significant decrease in the rate of acceleration occurred until after an indicated airspeed of 133 kt had been attained, there was then a slow build-up of speed to 137 kt over the next 2 sec after which deceleration commenced. Both pilots were applying full brakes but neither of them felt the anti-skid cycling.The aircraft continued to run straight some distance after initial braking was applied but then a veer to the right commenced. Opposite rudder was used but failed to check this forcing the use of differential braking to the extent that eventually the right brake had been eased off completely, whilst maximum left braking, full left rudder, full lateral control to the left, and nosewheel steering were being applied, These actions were only partly effective and the aircraft eventually left the runway and entered the grass strip. The turn to the right continued until finally the aircraft crossed the seawall.All four engines separated on impact with, the sea, the nose of the aircraft was smashed in and the fuselage above floor level between the flight deck and the leading edge of the wing was fractured in two places.

After completing the landing roll the crew requested permission to carry out a 180deg turnaround on the runway in order to vacate the runway at the runway 18/36 intersection which they had just passed. Permission was granted, but halfway during the turn the nosewheel slipped off the paved surface and the aircraft moved straight ahead off the runway.

The first officer, who was at the controls, heard a loud noise from the right side of the plane and experienced a yaw and movement of the flight controls as they passed the DC-9. Assuming that he was at or near V1, he aborted the takeoff. He closed the throttles, applied maximum braking and called for spoilers which the captain extended. Directional control was maintained, but the airplane overran the runway by 225 feet to the brow of a hill. The Boeing became airborne momentarily and contacted the ground approx. 67 feet further on, shearing the main undercarriage. The aircraft slid down the embankment and came to rest straddling a road 421 feet from the runway end. The fuselage upper structure ruptured forward of the wing root and the right wing failed inboard of the no. 4 engine.Investigation revealed that no. 4 engine sustained a compressor stall as it passed the DC-9 due to the jet blast from the idling engines of the Delta plane.

The aircraft was initially instructed to lineup on the runway and hold but, before it had entered the runway, this instruction was changed to a take-off clearance specifying that it would be a radar departure and that, after taking off, the aircraft was to turn right onto a heading of 050 degrees and to maintain 3,000 feet. This clearance was acknowledged and the pre-take off checks were conducted as the aircraft was turning onto the runway and lining up. These checks included a gyro compass comparison which was conducted as the aircraft heading passed through 010 degrees at which time the aircraft was 34 degrees from runway alignment. At 17:57 hours flight 812 commenced its take-off from a rolling start.The take-off was being carried out by the first officer from the right hand seat and, after the first officer had applied take-off thrust, the captain took control of the throttles while the flight engineer made fine adjustments to the throttle settings to balance the power. As the aircraft accelerated at an apparently normal rate the captain called progressively ""80 knots your steering"", ""one hundred"" and ""vee one"". Almost immediately after the ""vee one"" call the aircraft struck a flock of seagulls and there were two sharp reports from outside the aircraft. The captain observed a decay in number 2 engine EPR and aborted the take-off. The captain stated that he applied considerable braking simultaneously with the selection of speed brake and reverse thrust and full braking almost immediately afterwards. During the early stages of the deceleration, the flight engineer saw several flickers of the anti-skid lights on the brake panel, he noted that the hydraulic pressure was normal and saw that the four reverse lights were illuminated and that the N-values on all engines was about 110% with EPR indications ""well up"". When the captain took control of the aircraft the first officer assisted by maintaining the nosewheel on the ground and keeping the wings level and, when reverse thrust was applied, he also placed his feet on the brakes and found that the pedals were fully depressed.The aircraft overran the runway and struck sections of the approach lighting installation which caused the nose landing gear assembly and then the port main landing gear assembly to be removed. Finally, the nose of the aircraft came to rest partially embedded In soft ground 560 feet beyond the end of the runway and the crew and passengers then evacuated the aircraft.

The flight departed from McChord Air Force Base with 219 passengers and a crew of 10 aboard. It landed on runway 6L at Anchorage International Airport at 15:32 hours local time. During the landing rollout the captain used reverse thrust and medium heavy braking to bring the aircraft to a stop on the icy runway. Braking action was fair to poor and only light braking wasused while taxiing to the ramp. After the aircraft was parked and chocked at the terminal ramp the parking brakes were released.	The airplane was refueled with 117,227 pounds of JET-1-A fuel for a computed takeoff gross weight of 349,012 pounds. The allowable takeoff gross weight was 350,000 pounds. Because freezing drizzle was falling, the aircraft was deiced just prior to its departure from the ramp. The flight departed the ramp at approximately 16:54 and, upon request, received clearance to runway 6R.The takeoff checklist was completed except for the transponder and ignition override items, while the aircraft was being taxied to the runway. The flight was cleared to taxi into position to hold on runway 6R at 17:00:25, and was cleared for takeoff at 17:02:40.The captain stated that after the flight had been cleared into position he taxied slowly onto the runway and stopped the aircraft with the nose pointed slightly to the right of the centerline. He also stated he did not set the parking brakes while on the runway awaiting takeoff clearance and, further, that the parking brakes had not been reset at any time subsequent to brake release at the terminal ramp.The first officer had been previously assigned to make this takeoff and while the aircraft was in position on the runway, the captain briefed the flightcrew that he (the captain) would handle the brakes, set the engine power, and make the necessary airspeed calls attendant with the takeoff. The remaining checklist items were completed by the crew at approximately 17:03.The captain stated that he advanced the power to 80 percent (N2 compressor rpm), released the brakes and said, ""lets go to"" the first officer. He then advanced the throttles to the takeoff power of 1.87 EPR.No movement or sliding of the aircraft was noticed by the crew prior to the brake release.At around 145 knots the acceleration flattened out. Takeoff was continued since there was enough runway length remaining. When VR was called (153 knots) the aircraft was 1800-1500 feet from the end of the runway. The aircraft was rotated but did not leave the ground. After leaving the runway, the captain decided to abort the takeoff.It continued along the ground and struck a low wooden barrier, the instrument landing system (ILS) structure, and a 12-foot deep drainage ditch before coming to a stop approximately 3400 feet beyond the end of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed in the intense ground fire which developed subsequent to the crash.

Start up clearance was given at 09:21 hours and the aircraft taxied out six minutes later via the eastern taxiway for takeoff on runway 07. The tower advised the aircraft that the wind was 5 knots and variable in direction. At 09:32 hours, as the aircraft was backtracking to the takeoff point, the pilot reported a number of dead birds on the runway. He requested that these birds be removed before the aircraft took off. A fire truck was dispatched to take care of this. The aircraft continued to backtrack down the runway and turned in the pad at the end. It then lined up on the runway and stopped a short distance from the threshold. At 09:38:40 hours, the tower cleared the aircraft for takeoff. Shortly after the aircraft had passed the mid-point of the runway, at or just below the V1 speed, the nose wheel ran over a steel jacking pad. This jacking pad belonged to a Cessna 185 that had departed 4:40 hrs earlier. The pad punctured the right hand nose wheel tire. A loud bang was heard and severe vibration was felt on the flight deck. Almost immediately after the nose wheel tire had burst, the nose of the aircraft rose momentarily and then come down. The flight crew decided to abort the takeoff. The engines were throttled back and reverse thrust was selected. The aircraft continued down the runway, veering slightly to the right. Then the no.1 rear main tire burst. Just before the aircraft reached the end of the runway, it veered slightly to the left and ran approximately parallel to the centre line. After crossing a storm drain located at the end of the runway at right angles to the centre line, the aircraft became momentarily airborne as it left the lip of the embankment on which the 60 m stopway was laid. As it did so, the left outer wing of the aircraft struck a steel lattice tower forming part of the approach lighting system to runway 25. This ruptured the no. 1A fuel tank and the released fuel promptly ignited. Sixty metres beyond the end of the runway the aircraft fell heavily on to the lower ground 10.6 m below the runway level. It broke up immediately on impact and after sliding a short distance, came to rest and caught fire.",09:39,4 Rolls-Royce Conway 550,,,,EC720,18586,,,,,,

At 15:20 hrs six of the eight passengers to be carried on the return trip to Germany arrived at Blackpool Airport and, as it was raining, sat in the aircraft, the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of which was running. Two more passengers were expected. A flight plan was prepared for Munich via Rotterdam and filed at 15:30 hrs.The two passengers did not turn up at the appointed time and the APU was shut down while the passengers and crew waited in the aircraft. About 16:30 hrs word was received that the two extra passengers were not coming. This meant that extra fuel could be accommodated and a new flight plan direct to Munich could be prepared. It was filed by the first officer, while the captain carried out the pre-flight check. The captain then started the APU and sat in the left hand seat with the first officer in the right hand seat and, according to the passenger who survived the accident, indicated that the first officer should operate the aircraft in command under supervision.The aircraft taxied out and lined up and the surviving passenger saw the right hand wing slat extended when the first officer applied power with the brakes 'on' at the start of the take-off. The port side wing slat and the flaps were outside this passenger's field of view.During the take-off run the aircraft reached its normal rotation speed in the usual distance. However, although the aircraft was travelling fast enough, rotation did not take place and it did not become airborne. The surviving passenger saw the first officer's hand holding the throttles fully open and wondered why the aircraft did not take-off. Then he saw a gesture from the captain indicating that the take-off should be abandoned. The first officer immediately closed the throttles. Observers on the aerodrome heard the engine noise die down approximately 300 metres from the end of the runway. Subsequently brake marks were found commencing in the same area. Braking was not effective, however, and the aircraft left the end of the runway at high speed, in a level attitude with its nosewheel and main wheels in contact with the ground. Shortly before the first impact the surviving passenger noticed the captain's hand on the controls and saw aileron movement.The first collision occurred when the starboard wing tip struck and severed a post supporting one of the airfield runway approach lights. The aircraft continued, colliding with and badly distorting the double track railway lines at the edge of the airfield. The nose wheel of the landing gear was broken off by this impact and some structural damage was done to the underside of the fuselage. Almost immediately beyond the railway lines the aircraft broke through a wall and collided with a row of single storey masonry chalets in the adjacent holiday camp, demolishing six of them and setting them on fire.The wings were broken off during this impact, spilling fuel over the area, but the main part of the aircraft continued its progress, sustaining further structural damage as it did so. The forward part of the fuselage, including the flight deck, was twisted to starboard and progressively destroyed. The final impact brought the aircraft to rest against a second row of chalets which were also badly damaged. The wreckage caught fire and was destroyed. The crew of two and five of the six passengers on board were killed. The sixth passenger, although thrown clear, was seriously injured.",17:10 UTC,2 General Electric CJ610-1,,,,,2274,,,,,,

The passengers were six grooms who were intended to accompany the horses on the return flight.During the uneventful flight from Dublin to the Luton area the pilot received a surface wind forecast for Luton of 300/06 knots. At midnight contact was established with Luton Approach. The pilot was given the Luton landing conditions as: 'QNH 1013.5, CAVOK, (ceiling and visibility OK) surface wind practically calm' and asked if he would accept radar positioning for a visual approach to runway 08, to which he agreed. The radar positioning was terminated at 00.04 hrs when the aircraft was cleared to Luton tower frequency with 'Six track miles to run' and the runway in sight.When the pilot contacted Luton Tower at 00.05 hrs, he was cleared to land on runway 08 and given the surface wind as 300 degrees 04 knots. He acknowledged this last transmission and there was no further communication with the aircraft.The evidence indicates that the approach path and speed were normal. The commander did not notice the Indicated Air Speed (IAS) immediately before touchdown but recalled that the initial approach was made at approximately 130 knots IAS reducing to the target threshold speed of 115 knots as the flaps extended.The aircraft touched down at an IAS of 105 knots. The commander was of the opinion that, despite a tendency to float, the aircraft touched down at the correct distance down the runway, and, as soon as it had done so, he called for reverse thrust immediately the aircraft was on the runway. On receiving the commander's order, the engineer selected reverse thrust on numbers 2 and 3 engines followed by numbers 1 and 4 whilst monitoring the engine instruments. The commander was familiar with this method of selecting reverse which was the technique normally used in the company. The flight engineer did not see the blue warning lights illuminate to indicate that the propellers were moving into reverse pitch, he therefore selected Nos 1 and 4 propellers to forward pitch, with throttles closed, in case the reason for the malfunction was an electrical overload due to operation of all four feathering/reversing pumps at low engine rpm. The commander had also noticed that the blue lights had not illuminated and, seeing that Nos 1 and 4 propellers were selected to forward pitch, called 'reverse all engines'. In response to his order the engineer made the required selection and all four throttle levers were seen to be in the reverse quadrant by the operating crew, although no blue lights were noted. The aircraft was not decelerating during this period and that no reverse thrust was achieved.The commander ordered the engineer to 'put them in the middle', thus to cancel the reverse thrust selections. There were two short periods of engine acceleration during the landing roll.The commander assisted by the first officer applied the toe brakes, assessed them to be ineffective and, as the aircraft was still not decelerating, applied the emergency pneumatic brakes by turning the operating handle to 'on'. The commander did not notice any deceleration and, consequently, did not follow the procedure of selecting them alternatively to 'hold' and to 'on'. All four main wheels locked, the tyres burst and further retardation from the brakes was lost. Sparks and smoke were seen emanating from the area of the undercarriage when the aircraft approached the end of the runway. When it became apparent that the aircraft would overrun the runway the commander called to have the 'switches' put to 'OFF'. The flight engineer selected the ignition switches off before the aircraft left the end of the runway and ploughed across the overrun area. It was still travelling fast enough to follow a trajectory off the top of the bank at the end of the runway leaving no wheel marks down the slope. The aircraft stopped in soft ground 90 metres from the end of the runway at the foot of the bank having demolished part of the aerodrome fence and some of the approach lights.All persons on board abandoned the aircraft without delay. As the flight engineer was leaving via the right hand side crewdoor, he noticed a small fire under the number 3 engine. He returned to the cockpit, pulled the firewall shut-off controls and discharged a fire extinguisher to all four engines.",00:08 UTC,4 Wright R-3350 (988TC18),,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier in the day the aircraft and crew had NS551 from London to Bilbao and after an uneventful flight had landed at Bilbao on runway 10 at 12:31. At the time of landing light rain was falling and the runway was wet. No standing water was seen on the runway during the landing run.While the aircraft was being prepared for the return flight rain fell intermittently varying in intensity from moderate to heavy, but abating to light as the aircraft taxied out for takeoff. Weather was reported to the crew as: Surface Wind: calm; runway in use: 28; QNH: 1014 mbs. Start-up was normal and at 13:37 the aircraft was cleared to taxi and to hold short of the runway because of landing traffic - a Caravelle. The crew watched the Caravelle land on runway 10 and the Flight Engineer commented to his two colleagues on the considerable amount of water spray being thrown up at the rear of this aircraft during its landing run. The Commander remarked that he would assess the runway conditions while back-tracking to the takeoff position from the taxiway entrance to the runway. He noted a number of pools of standing water on the runway surface as the Trident back-tracked along the runway. Although he could not estimate their area or depth, the pools appeared to be well within the limits imposed for takeoff using 510 (normal) power. The taxi drills were actioned by the First Officer and the Flight Engineer during this time and ""runway items"" were completed after the Commander turned the aircraft through 180° close to the threshold of runway 28, aligned it on the runway centre line, and selected the wheel brakes to park. A power setting of 100 per cent thrust was made, all engine indications were checked as correct, and the engine relight switches were selected 'ON' before the wheel brakes were released and the takeoff run commenced at about 13:46 with the Commander piloting the aircraft. The aircraft accelerated normally ; the First Officer called out the indicated airspeeds at 80 knots and 100 knots and made a call of 'Wet V1' at 117 knots then removed his hand from the throttles. At the time or just after 'Wet V1' was called the Flight Engineer and the First Officer heard a noise which the latter crew member attributed to the aircraft's entry into standing water. According to the Flight Engineer the aircraft appeared to decelerate at the same time that he heard the noise.The Commander felt a marked deceleration consistent with a loss of engine power, whereupon he immediately closed the throttles, called ""Abandon"", deployed the airbrakes and lift dumpers and applied the wheel brakes fully. However according to the Flight Engineer all engine indications had been normal prior to the closing of the throttles. On seeing a hand close the throttles the First Officer selected emergency reverse thrust on the pod engines, checked the engine indications were correct and maintained the application of emergency reverse thrust until the aircraft eventually came to rest. The First Officer and the Commander checked the indicated pressures on the wheel brake gauges which showed the wheel brakes were fully applied. The initial deceleration felt satisfactory to the crew, then quickly deteriorated and the First Officer formed the impression that the aircraft was aquaplaning. The Flight Engineer then noticed that the aircraft had begun to drift gradually to the left of the runway centreline apparently as the result of a deliberate action by the Commander. Subsequently it became evident to the Commander that he could not bring the aircraft to a halt within the runway confines. Some 200 metres to 300 metres before the end of the runway he turned the aircraft to the left using nose-wheel steering and applied full left rudder. As the nose wheels ran off the runway onto the grass, the aircraft slewed to the left then skidded broadside to the right for a short distance before it came to an abrupt stop at the side of the runway in a right wing down attitude with the right wing tip close to the threshold lights of runway 10.Evacuation drills were initiated and the passengers left the aircraft in a reasonably orderly manner, the majority by slide from the main exit doors and foremost right overwing emergency exit. Catering equipment in the galleys came out of stowage during the accident obstructing access to the forward emergency exit door and preventing use of this exit and its slide during the evacuation.",13:48 UTC,3 Rolls-Royce Spey 512-5W,,,,552,12892,,,,,,

Until the aircraft started its takeoff run no birds had been noticed which could have been a hazard to the aircraft but nevertheless, in accordance with normal bird strike precautionary procedures, the aircraft took-off with its landing lights as well as strobe and navigation lights on. At the moment the aircraft started to roll eye-witnesses saw a large flock of birds rise from the grass verge north of and towards the eastern end of the runway, apparently having been disturbed by an incoming Harrier aircraft as it taxied west along the perimeter track after landing. This track lies about 120 metres north of and parallel to the runway at this point. These birds rose into the air in a fairly dense formation and wheeled south across the runway just as the HS-125 became airborne. Other witnesses noticed a second bird flock rise from the centre of the aerodrome at the same time and fly north. The aircraft became airborne shortly before the halfway point of the runway and the commander had just reduced power from 100% to between 98 and 96% and ordered the undercarriage raised when the aircraft, then at a height of 50 to 100 feet and a speed of approximately 150 knots, met either or both of the bird flocks. The commander heard and felt a series of bangs as birds hit the aircraft. The ground witnesses describe hearing the engines at high power prior to the aircraft encountering the birds, and then hearing a succession of noises (between one to three), variously described as a muffled explosion, bang, thump, boom or whoomf followed by the cessation of the high power engine noise. At the same time balls of flame, lasting between one to three seconds, appeared at the rear of each engine. Some witnesses also saw birds falling away from the aircraft, and after the accident the remains of 11 dead birds identified as Lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) were found at a point about 1,170 metres from the commencement of the runway, i.e. a little over half way. The largest of the dead birds weighed 303g and had a wingspan of 61cm. Although neither pilot noticed any instrument indications following the bird strike the commander sensed an immediate decrease in acceleration which he considered was due to a complete loss of power on both engines; he also thought that some of the bangs were caused by the engines surging. He therefore decreased the climb attitude to maintain flying speed, partially reduced the throttle setting, and then re-opened to full throttle, but as far as he was aware there was no increase in thrust from either engine. He therefore decided to make a forced landing straight ahead and called for the undercarriage to be extended and for full flaps; simultaneously he closed the throttles and lowered the nose of the aircraft to assume the appropriate attitude for an approach to land. The aircraft touched down on the mainwheels about 180 metres before the end of the runway at a speed the commander estimated as approximately 120 knots; after lowering the nosewheel onto the ground he applied full wheel brakes which he maintained throughout the whole of the landing run. The aircraft overran the end of the runway and continued in a straight line across grass fields and through hedges before striking a ditch on the west side of the A281 road, about 285 metres beyond the end of the runway; the impact with the ditch ruptured and initiated the detachment of the entire undercarriage. The aircraft then bounced across the road at an estimated speed of 85 knots and in so doing struck and demolished a passing private Ford Cortina motor car; all six occupants of the car were killed. The aircraft continued on it underside for about 150 metres across a field on the far side of the road. Shortly before it came to a stop the commander closed the high pressure fuel cocks. Noticing light behind him the commander assumed the aircraft was on fire and ordered an immediate evacuation; the forward entry door was opened when the aircraft came to a stop and all nine occupants safely evacuated it before the fire spread.",16:11 UTC,2 Rolls-Royce Viper 601,,,,,373,Fatalities: 6,,,,,

The Boeing 727 departed New York at 12:00 AST. On approach to St. Thomas, at 15:04, the flight crew cancelled their IFR flight plan and proceeded VFR. The captain elected to use the runway 09 ILS for vertical guidance. The glide slope was intercepted at 1500 feet msl (flaps 15deg and at a 160 KIAS airspeed). The flaps were lowered to 25 and later to 30 degrees. The company prescribed 40 degrees was never selected. The speed was still 10 KIAS above Vref when the aircraft passed the threshold at an estimated altitude of 30-40 feet. At 1000 feet down the runway, while initiating the flare, turbulence caused the right wing to drop. The wings were leveled and the aircraft floated a while until touchdown 2200-2300 feet down the runway. The captain decided that the aircraft couldn't be stopped on the remaining runway. He immediately initiated a go-around. Because of the absence of any sensation either of power being applied or of aircraft acceleration, the throttles were closed again. The aircraft, in a 11 degree nose up attitude, ran off the runway and struck a localizer antenna.

The inbound flight to Sumburgh had been made without incident and no significant malfunction of the aircraft had been reported.The crew, consisting of two pilots and a stewardess, then had a stopover of nearly seven hours before departing on the return flight, Dan-Air 0034, with 44 passengers on board. It has not been established who was the handling pilot on this sector.At 15:48 hrs, in conditions of moderate visibility, but with low cloud, rain and a fresh easterly wind, the aircraft was taxied out to the holding point 'India', the intersection of the disused runway and runway 15/33. Meanwhile the stewardess gave the company's standard safety briefmg, using a megaphone because the passenger address (PA) system was 'screeching'. The briefing included mention of the location of the lifejackets, how they should be put on, and the method of inflation; also mentioned was the location of the emergency exits. A diagram displaying the method of donning the jackets was fixed to the forward bulkhead of the cabin.Because of other aircraft movements, 'KF' was held at point 'India' for six minutes before being cleared, at 15:57 hrs, to 'enter and backtrack' for a take-off on runway 09, which was virtually into wind. Whilst the aircraft was backtracking, ATC passed the crew the en route clearance, which was read back correctly by the co-pilot. The aircraft was seen to turn close to the western end of the runway and line up on the runway heading. At 15:59 hrs the flight received take-off clearance from ATC and this was acknowledged by the co-pilot. There is evidence to show that the engines were accelerated whilst the aircraft was held stationary on the brakes and that full take-off power, using watermethanol, was achieved on the take-off run, which commenced at almost exactly 16:00 hrs.Evidence from the aircraft's Flight Data Recorder (FDR) shows that the aircraft accelerated normally through the decision speed, V1 (92 kts), to the rotation and safety speed VR/2 (99 kts). No rotation was carried out and even though the aircraft reached a speed significantly higher than VR of the order of 113 kts, it failed to become airborne.About 5 seconds after reaching the scheduled rotation speed, and after passing the intersection with the disused runway, the aircraft began to decelerate. Veering gradually to the left as it crossed the grass overrun area, it then made contact with a discontinuity or 'step', approximately 40 centimetres high, at the edge of the airfield perimeter road and partial collapse of the undercarriage followed. After crossing the road in a left wing low and nose down attitude the aircraft passed over the inclined sea defences and came to rest in the sea some 50 metres from the shore line.The emergency services arrived at the point on the road adjacent to the crash site within two minutes of the accident. However, about a minute later the aircraft sank, nose first, in some ten metres of water, leaving only the rear section of the fuselage visible. Twenty-nine passengers and the stewardess were rescued, or managed to swim to the shore, under adverse weather conditions. Despite rescue attempts mounted from the shore, by small craft and by helicopters summoned to the scene, fifteen passengers and the two pilots died by drowning.",16:01,2 Rolls-Royce Dart 514,,,,0034,29007,,,,,,

While circling, the landing gear was cycled four times, after which both main gear lights remained unsafe. The emergency lowering system was activated but was unsuccessful.Shortly after touchdown, the right main gear collapsed, and the aircraft veered to the right, off the runway.Investigation at the scene failed to determine the cause of the gear's collapsing, but it was determined that the right main gear side brace (hydraulic actuator) was not in the locked position. Until the main gear side braces are fully extended, the unsafe gear light remains on. It is believed that the left side brace locked in the down position, during the landing roll.The side braces were removed and examined at the manufacturer's facility. During the test of the right side brace, pressure higher than that normally supplied by the aircraft hydraulic system was required to operate the side brace. The emergency landing gear extension operated normally, but the additional pressure required to lower the landing gear caused the emergency system to be ineffective. A set of new gland seals was installed, and the side brace tested satisfactorily under normal operating pressures. No defects were found in the side brace gland seals that were removed.

The aircraft took off from runway 22R at Copenhagen Airport at 10:04 hours local time. The co-pilot, who was under route training, performed the takeoff and climb-out. The take-off run was normal. The aircraft started to drift to the right immediately at rotation and lift-off, which was noticed by both pilots and commented by the captain. The co-pilot corrected the yaw by means of left rudder input and subsequent trim, and without problems he engaged the autopilot with the aircraft being trimmed 3 - 4 units left trim input. As the speed increased, the mistrim increased. After disengagement of the autopilot the copilot trimmed up to 9 units left. At that point he informed the captain of the magnitude of the trim. The captain took over, reduced the speed, and started troubleshooting. The troubleshooting consisted in feeling the aircraft's reaction to manual rudder at different speeds, yaw damper influence, and possible spoiler floating. The malfunction check-list was consulted afterwards. Nothing could be found to explain the rudder mistrim. After discussion between captain and co-pilot, and in agreement with the company maintenance control centre, which was contacted, the captain decided to return to Copenhagen. The rudder control had been returned to powered rudder in order to achieve best effectiveness. The captain has stated that he was concerned about a suspected increase in the minimum control speed. The captain decided to follow parts of the emergency landing check-list by selecting 25 flaps instead of full flaps and not arming the spoilers. He had previously informed the purser and the passengers about the return as being due to a minor technical fault. He saw no reason to declare an emergency, and consequently the cabin was not prepared for one. The approach was performed with some overspeed. According to the captain's statements, he decided to add about 10 kts to the approach and threshold speed of 139 KIAS in order to be well above the minimum control speed of 135 KIAS. From the flight data recorder the speed at touch down was measured to approximately 160 kts. Rudder trim was 6.5 units left with ailerons trimmed left. The approach and landing was uneventful up to the point when the aircraft began to drift off to the right. The nose wheel touched down approximately 600 metres from the threshold of the runway. When the nose was lowered and the captain had to neutralize rudder in order to line up the nose wheel, the aircraft immediately veered to the right. The captain immediately applied left rudder - which soon became full rudder, full left wheel breaking, and later full left reversing. The aircraft left the runway sideslipping slightly to the right, rolled on the grass along the runway, still sideslipping slightly (around 7°) , crossed runway 12/30, hit a marker board with the right main gear, and gradually returned to the right side of the runway. At this point the captain reduced left reversing as he felt tendencies to an impending ground loop. The nose gear hit a concrete well cover outside the runway. The final collapse of the nose gear occurred during the last part of the landing sequence, and the aircraft finally came to rest on the runway with the nose off-centered slightly to the left. The aircraft stopped approximately 1500 metres from the threshold. After completion of the ""on ground emergency check-list"", neither the emergency power light nor the public address blue light came on when the captain had pressed the light cap. As the captain had trouble in finding the hand set, which had fallen to the floor, he rose to open the cockpit door. He was met by the purser, who then, on order from the captain, ordered emergency evacuation over the megaphone. Four passengers were brought to hospital with injuries incurred during the evacuation.",10:48,2 Pratt & Whitney JT8D-11,,Repaired,,SK551,28501,,,,27947,,

Despite the fact that it was not allowed to carry out a blind landing on this flight, the copilot or engineer did not intervene.The aircraft crossed the runway centreline at a height of 10 meters and one second before landing, the blinds were opened by the engineer.

The training flight commenced from Lagos with the trainee Captain on the left seat as the Pilot Flying while the Instructor Captain was on the right seat as Pilot-in-Command. The point of intended landing and subsequent trainings was Ilorin Airport.Flight preparation was completed by the crew and ground dispatchers with 60.3 metric tonnes of fuel up-lift giving an estimated endurance of 8 hours.The flight was normal up till the altitude of 3,000ft when the aircraft was inside the control zone of Ilorin Control Tower which had cleared the aircraft for a touch and go on runway 05. At 1000 ft AGL the aircraft had its landing gears in the down position and landing flaps set at 35. At 400 ft AGL the auto-pilot was disconnected and later at 80 ft the autothrottles were also disconnected. The aircraft was fully established on the ILS.As the trainee captain was on his very first flight on the aircraft type, the Nigeria Airways DC-10 flight transition syllabus item 9 has it that the sequence of training at this point in time should be '3 engine or single land demonstration-Full stop'. As the aircraft had already requested and cleared for a touch and go and established on ILS, it was clear that item 9 had been skipped and item 10 ""3 engine Flight Director ILS approach -Touch and Go"" was in progress.The trainee captain crossed the 05 threshold rather high at about 60 ft or more and a long time, interspersed with instructions by the instructor captain, was spent before the aircraft had its main landing gears on the ground at about 2,913 ft (888 m) from the threshold. Runway 05 had a Landing Distance Available if 3100 m.It appeared that the trainee captain did not receed the throttles fully back for the touch-down and the Instructor had to assist in doing so.The trainee captain then appeared to be holding the nose-wheel off the ground and again the Instructor had to push the control column down.On nose-wheel touch-down, the trainee immediately requested for take-off power.The Instructor went into the aircraft re-configuration procedure after the landing and was still busy on the required settings when the trainee Pilot raised an alarm as the runway threshold was approaching.The Instructor looked out into the 900m of slight haze visibility, felt that the aircraft would not take-off with the limited runway available and immediately reached out to deploy the spoilers at the same time stepped on the brakes. Abort take-off was not announced.At this point in time the engine throttles had already been advanced for take-off.Tha aircraft was on heavy braking from about 1,390 ft (424 m) before runway end as it overran the runway.The aircraft made significant impacts with the ILS antenna bars, electrical switch posts and the approach light support structures of runway 23 all located on the runway 05 clearway before it came to a halt.The location of the accident site was 44 meters to the left of the centre-line and 649 meters along the extended centre-line.

Shortly after lifting off, at 200 feet above the ground, the engine torque gauges began to fluctuate erratically and the plane began to yaw back and forth. The captain believed the TTL (Torque Temperature Limiting) system may have been bypassing fuel to the engines (a situation that could occur when power levers are advanced too far forward). He then slightly decreased the power settings which resulted in even greater torque oscillations and greater yawing. The captain believed both engines were malfunctioning for some unknown reason and landed back on runway 19, because a 90deg turn for runway 28 seemed impossible.

While taxiing for departure, the captain checked for the second time the movement of the elevators but failed to notice they were locked.

The captain pulled the control column during VR, but the aircraft did not respond. Four seconds later he called out to abort the takeoff. At this time the aircraft had attained a speed of 293 km/h. Instead of using reverse thrust, the flight engineer shut down all four engines.

Approaching Vagar at approximately 14:45 hours the weather conditions were below minima (300 ft / 2 kilometres) and flight 453 had to divert to Bergen Airport, Norway, where it arrived at 15:22 hours.Weather improved slightly but enough to be above minima. Flight 453 then departed Bergen at 17:02 hours. At 17:46 hours the co-pilot radioed to Vagar, that they were estimating ""NL"" (NDB) in about 30 minutes. As they received information about the visibility being 3000 metres in rain and the ceiling being 700 ft, they replied that they would report again on final approach. At 18:05 hours the co-pilot reported that they were established inbound (runway 31) and were leaving 7000 ft on an LLZ/DME approach runway 31. Visibility and ceiling were then given as 2500 metres and 300 ft. The runway was reported clear and wet with standing water percentage 25. The wind was 240°/5 kt.The captain has stated that a missed approach was carried out, as the aircraft's position in relation to the runway was not ideal for a landing. However the AFIS-operator's stated the missed approach was carried out due to visibility being below minima.As the AFIS-operator at 18:17 hours informed the crew about the visibility to the east being exactly 2 kilometres, unable to see the cloud base, and visibility to the west being 3 kilometres, cloud base 400 ft, wind 05 knots, it was decided to make an approach to runway 13. The co-pilot radioed to the AFIS-operator, that they were able to take a 10 knots tailwind and was then told, that the wind at threshold 13 was 230°/11 kts and that threshold 31 was the same.At 18:23 hours the co-pilot reported ""MY "" (NDB) inbound runway 13. A LLZ/DME approach was carried out with V REF being 119 knots. At 1.2 NM DME, or just before the minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 680 ft, the crew obtained visual contact with the runway lights and the approach was continued with reference to the lights and to the PAPI. During the final approach phase, the captain had his doubt about a possible overshoot of the marked touchdown zone; however, there was no doubt in his mind that the landing would be successful.Air brakes were deployed between 100 ft and 50 ft above the runway. After threshold-passage the captain was, due to the heavy rain, so occupied by aiming at the proper touchdown point, that he did not notice the airspeed. The touchdown was according to the two pilots statements within the prescribed touchdown zone. Neither of the two pilots recall the touchdown speed. Further to the captain's statement braking action was felt normal in the beginning of the landing run, but about 2/3 down the runway the speed remained unchanged although both pilots applied full pressure on the brakes. Coming close to the runway end, the captain realized that an overrun was inevitable and turned the aircraft to the right on to the high speed turn-off area .The deceleration of the aircraft was not as expected and the captain turned the aircraft further to the right into rising terrain. Although there was no instructions or procedures for the use of the high speed turn-off area, the captain had expected that the wheels of the aircraft would have penetrated the surface as the brakes were fully depressed.The passengers, who disembarked the aircraft within about 30 seconds, sustained no injuries.

Holding on the taxiway at BWI for 1.5 hours required the flight to return to the terminal area for fuel. The Boeing 737-400 left BWI uneventfully and arrived at LGA's Gate 15 at 20:40.Weather and air traffic in the LGA terminal area had caused cancellations and delayed most flights for several hours. The USAir dispatcher decided to cancel the Norfolk leg of Flight 1846, unload the passengers, and send the flight to Charlotte (CLT) without passengers. Several minutes later, the dispatcher told the captain that his airplane would not be flown empty but would carry passengers to Charlotte as USAir flight 5050. This seemed to upset the captain. He expressed concern for the passengers because more delays would cause him and the first officer to exceed crew duty time limitations before the end of the trip. While passengers were boarding, the captain visited USAir's ground movement control tower to ask about how decisions were made about flights and passengers.The captain returned to the cockpit as the last of the passengers were boarding, and the entry door was closed. After the jetway was retracted, the passenger service representative told the captain through the open cockpit window that he wanted to open the door again to board more passengers. The captain refused, and flight 5050 left Gate 15 at 22:52.The 737 taxied out to runway 31. Two minutes after push-back, the ground controller told the crew to hold short of taxiway Golf Golf. However, the captain failed to hold short of that taxiway and received modified taxi instructions from the ground controller at 22:56. The captain then briefed takeoff speeds as V1: 125 knots, VR: 128 knots, and V2: 139 knots. The first officer was to be the flying pilot. He was conducting his first nonsupervised line takeoff in a Boeing 737.About 2 minutes later, the first officer announced ""stabilizer and trim"" as part of the before-takeoff checklist. The captain responded with ""set"" and then corrected himself by saying: ""Stabilizer trim, I forgot the answer. Set for takeoff."" Flight 5050 was cleared into position to hold at the end of the runway at 23:18:26 and received takeoff clearance at 23:20:05. The first officer pressed the autothrottle disengage and then pressed the TO/GA button, but noted no throttle movement. He then advanced the throttles manually to a ""rough"" takeoff-power setting. The captain then said: ""Okay, that's the wrong button pushed"" and 9 seconds later said: ""All right, I'll set your power."" During the takeoff roll the airplane began tracking to the left. The captain initially used the nosewheel steering tiller to maintain directional control. About 18 seconds after beginning the roll a ""bang"" was heard followed shortly by a loud rumble, which was due to the cocked nosewheel as a result of using the nosewheel steering during the takeoff roll. At 23:20:53, the captain said ""got the steering."" The captain later testified that he had said, ""You've got the steering."" The first officer testified that he thought the captain had said: ""I've got the steering."" When the first officer heard the captain, he said ""Watch it then"" and began releasing force on the right rudder pedal but kept his hands on the yoke in anticipation of the V1 and rotation callouts.At 23:20:58.1, the captain said: ""Let's take it back then"" which he later testified meant that he was aborting the takeoff. According to the captain, he rejected the takeoff because of the continuing left drift and the rumbling noise. He used differential braking and nose wheel steering to return toward the centerline and stop. The throttle levers were brought back to their idle stops at 23:20:58.4. The indicated airspeed at that time was 130 knots. Increasing engine sound indicating employment of reverse thrust was heard on the CVR almost 9 seconds after the abort maneuver began. The airplane did not stop on the runway but crossed the end of the runway at 34 knots ground speed. The aircraft dropped onto the wooden approach light pier, which collapsed causing the aircraft break in three and drop into 7-12 m deep East River. The accident was not survivable for the occupants of seats 21A and 21B because of the massive upward crush of the cabin floor.",23:21,2 CFMI CFM56-3B2,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),7 m (23 feet) amsl,US5050,2235,,,,1730,,

An updated report received some 30 minutes before descent confirmed the wind as 290 degrees at 7 knots. Approaching the island and becoming visual, the crew noted the windsock near the western end of the runway to be indicating a slight headwind component in the 10 direction and decided on a straight in approach to runway 10, to avoid an approaching squall/shower. The aircraft touched down firmly a short distance beyond the threshold. Speed brakes were immediately extended and wheel braking applied.

Destination was Eket. Enroute, the captain briefed his copilot that the wind was northerly at 2 knots. He decided to use runway 19. He also briefed that they would descend to the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) of 500 ft. and if they did not have the field in sight by then, they would carry out a missed approach, maintain runway heading and climb to 1,500 ft. From Lagos, they were cruising at 11,000 ft. and started the descent at about 77 nm from Port Harcourt, which was close to Eket. On clearance to 5000 ft by Port Harcourt Approach Control, the crew called Eket Control who descended them to 3,500 ft. At about 10 nm from Eket the NDB frequency was picked up and the crew informed Eket that they were leaving 3500ft for 1500. When the aircraft came overhead the NDB they shot the approach. On the outbound leg of 195 they turned 45° for a right procedure turn and still maintaining 1500ft. Flap 1 was selected with the speed lever set in the high RPM position. With the runway inbound on track 105 magnetic, the landing gear was selected in the down position and the aircraft was descended to 500ft. After 90 seconds into the final approach on runway 01, the co-pilot called out ""runway-in-sight"" but the captain thought the aircraft was high, so he announced he was overshooting, whereas, while giving evidence the co-pilot said she advised the overshoot when the ADF needle swung. Another approach was attempted. They came back to the same runway 01 to maintain the MDA and the runway was sighted from about 2 miles out at 400ft height. The co-pilot thought the airplane was high and called for a missed approach. Then another landing attempt was made for runway 19. At about between 600 - 700ft height above the approach path, the captain instructed his co-pilot ""when you see the field, give me flaps 2, I am going to land"". As soon as the co-pilot sighted the runway at about 2nm out, she selected flap 2. The captain descended for the field and while they came over the threshold, the speed was between 95 and 98 knots. Height above threshold was 300ft; the co-pilot felt that the airplane was high, but she thought that at flap 2 the aircraft was committed to land. This time the First Officer did not warn the captain though she felt that the aircraft was high. The captain said that he descended fast from 300ft with the target aim of touching down at about the 6th centre line marking from the threshold. After the touchdown, the captain applied reverse pitch but no effect of the deceleration was felt. He then moved the throttle levers to the maximum reverse position, yet there was no deceleration effect. The next action was to go on the brakes while the aircraft still had the rolling speed of about 80 knots. The captain felt that only the right brakes were effective because-the airplane skidded to the right; when there was no directional control, the captain said that he then used the opposite rudder for control. The commander was still fighting with the directional control when the airplane overran the end of the paved way at about 40 knots with the brakes still applied. The airplane sustained damage to the wheels and propellers. The fuselage was buckled just forward of the left wing leading-edge and at the fuselage/wing rear attachment point. Also the right hand side of the fuselage had bucklings at the forward section.",09:56 UTC,2 Garrett TPE331,,,,,2819,,,,,,

The outside air temperature (OAT) was 30 degrees C, with a north westerly wind at 5 kt. It was loaded to its maximum all up weight (MAUW), and configured for a flapless takeoff. This being normal requirements for the aircraft operating at MAUW with an OAT greater than 28 degrees C. The calculated V1 speed was 140 kt, and the VR speed 148 kt. With the co-pilot at the controls the aircraft taxied the 4 km to the threshold of runway 29 for departure. The takeoff run was normal until the aircraft had travelled approximately 2,000 m and accelerated to 128 kt. At this point the left main wheel tyre suffered a blow out causing the aircraft to veer left. The captain took control and rejected the takeoff. Whilst he was attempting to maintain directional control, using brakes and nose wheel steering, the right main wheel tyre also blew out and the aircraft swung to the right, departing the runway and coming to a stop on the flight strip in the reciprocal direction to the takeoff. The left main gear leg collapsed, and the aircraft suffered damage to the left gear attachment structure, left fuel tank cell, and the infra-red dome mounted to the lower fuselage surface. All occupants evacuated safely. The left main wheel and tyre remains were examined at the CAA Materials Evaluation Facility. The examination revealed that all three fusible plugs in the wheel hub were loose. Although it could not be established if the fusible plugs were tight before the accident, enquires indicated that they had not been touched by any other party prior to the wheel coming into BASI's possession. The valve, and gasket between the wheel hub halves, were in good condition, and no flaws or defects were found in the tyre material, or its manufacturing process. An uneven wear pattern across the tread was noted, being more advanced on the middle tread and shoulders than on the intervening sections of tread. The wear along the tyre shoulders is consistent with under-inflation, but as there was also some wear on the middle tread it was apparent that the tyre had been correctly, or possibly over inflated at some time. Over a period of time an undetected slow leak had probably occurred, with the wear pattern indicating that the tyre had been under-inflated for a number of takeoffs and landings. In this condition the sidewalls would have been subjected to increased flexing, resulting in excessive heat generation and delamination between the fabric layers. Eventually the tyre would have been unable to sustain these flexing loads, resulting in rapid deflation and shredding of the tyre from the wheel. The aircraft operating at MAUW, the hot tarmac, and long taxiing distance would have exacerbated the situation.",09:09,,,Repaired,,,,,,,,,

Because G-JETB had arrived at Oxford (OXF) the previous evening, the airplane had to be ferried to Southampton early in the morning. This as a regular occurrence.The co-pilot had agreed with the airport authorities at both Oxford and Southampton that the aircraft would operate outside normal hours on the understanding that no fire cover would be provided. Following the takeoff from Oxford at 05:19 the crew contacted Brize Norton ATC and agreed a Flight Information Service. They maintained VMC for the transit at 2,400 feet QNH and called Southampton ATC on their alternate radio at 05:25 when they were approximately 30 nm from Southampton. The Southampton controller was surprised at their initial call and advised them that the airport did not open until 06:00. The crew informed him that arrangements had been made for an early arrival and the controller asked them to standby while he checked this agreement. At 05:27 he called G-JETB, informed the crew that they could land before the normal opening hours and asked them to confirm that no fire cover was required. The crew confirmed this and were then told that runway 02 was in use with a wind of 020 deg./14 kt and that there was a thunderstorm right over the airport. The crew then advised Brize Norton radar that they were going to Southampton ATC and left the Brize Norton frequency. Following a further check with Southampton they were given the 0520 weather observation: ""Surface wind 040 deg/12 kt, thunderstorms, 2 oktas of stratus at 800 feet, 3 oktas of cumulonimbus at 1,800 feet, temperature 12 C, qnh 1007 mb, qfe 1006 mb, the runway is very wet.""At 05:30 the controller asked the crew for the aircraft type and, after being told that it was a Citation II, told the crew that the visibility was deteriorating (""Now 2,000 metres in heavy thunderstorms"" ) and cleared them to the Southampton VOR at 3,000 feet QNH. After checking that they were now IFR the controller confirmed the clearance, and the QNH of 1007 mb, and informed the crew that there was no controlled airspace and that he had no radar available to assist them. Shortly afterwards the controller advised the crew that: ""Entirely at your discretion you may establish on the ILS localiser for runway 20 for visual break-off to land on runway 02."" The commander accepted this offer and, within the cockpit, asked the co-pilot for the surface wind. He was informed that it was 040 degrees but that earlier they had been given 020 deg/14 kt. At 05:32 the commander had positioned on the ILS for runway 20 and began his descent; the co-pilot advised Southampton that they were established. The controller acknowledged this and again passed the QNH.Shortly afterwards he asked the crew to report at the outer marker and this message was acknowledged. At 05:33 the crew called that they were visual with the runway and the controller cleared them for a visual approach, left or right at their convenience, for runway 02. As this transmission was taking place, the commander informed his co-pilot that they would land on runway 20. The commander decided this because he could see that the weather at the other end of the runway appeared very black and he had mentally computed the tailwind component to be about 10 kt. After a confirmation request from the co-pilot to the commander, the co-pilot informed the Southampton controller that they would land on runway 20. The controller then advised them that: ""You'll be landing with a fifteen knot, one five knot, tailwind component on a very wet runway"" ; this was immediately acknowledged by the co-pilot with: ""roger, copied thank you"".The crew continued with their approach, initially at 15 kt above their computed threshold speed (VREF) of 110 kt and then at a constant VREF+10 kt. Within the cockpit the commander briefed the co-pilot that if they were too fast the co-pilot was to select flap to the takeoff position and they would go-around; they also discussed the use of the speedbrake and the commander stated that he would call for it when he wanted it. The speed at touchdown was within 5 kt of the target threshold speed and touchdown was in the vicinity of the Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPIs), according to witnesses in the Control Tower and on the airport; the commander was certain that he had made a touchdown within the first 300 feet of the runway. The PAPIs are located 267 metres along the runway. Speedbrake was selected as the aircraft touched down and, although the commander applied and maintained heavy foot pressure on the brakes, no retardation was apparent; external observers reported heavy spray from around the aircraft. At some stage down the runway the commander stated that the brakes were not stopping them and the co-pilot called for a go-around ; the commander replied : ""No we can't"" as he considered that a go-around at that stage would be more dangerous. He maintained brake pressure and, in an attempt to increase distance, steered the aircraft to the right edge of the runway before trying to steer back left. Initially the aircraft nose turned to the left and the aircraft slid diagonally off the right side of the runway on to the grass. It continued across the grass for a distance of approximately 233 metres while at the same time yawing to the left. However, 90 metres beyond the end of the runway there is an embankment which forms the side of the M27 motorway and G-JETB slid down this embankment on to the motorway. The aircraft continued to rotate as it descended and came to rest, having turned through approximately 150 degrees, with its tail on the central barrier. During these final manoeuvres the aircraft collided with two cars travelling on the eastbound carriageway; the aircraft and one of the cars caught fire. During the approach of the aircraft, the airport Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) duty officer had discussed with the duty ATC controller the imminent arrival of G-JETB. Although not all checks had been complete, the fire officer offered his two fire vehicles as a weather standby ; he did not declare his section operational but agreed with ATC that they would position themselves to the west of the runway. When the aircraft was 1/2 to 2/3 down the runway, the ATC controller considered that the aircraft would not stop in the runway available and activated the crash alarm. The fire section obtained clearance to enter the runway after G-JETB had passed their position and followed the aircraft. Assessing the situation on the move, the fire officer ordered the FIRE 2 vehicle to disperse through the crash gate to the motorway, and took his own vehicle (FIRE 1) to the edge of the embankment. On arrival, the fire section contained the fires. The occupants of the aircraft and cars escaped with minor injuries .",05:34,2 Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D-4,,,,,4315,,,,3306,,

According to the crew and test personnel onboard the airplane, several electrical spikes occurred while in flight to the alternating current (AC) system. The captain stated that the left engine's fire warning light illuminated several times along with other fluctuating instruments. He secured the left engine and used the fire extinguishing system which resulted in the warning light going out and a loss of AC power to the airplane. A successful single engine landing was accomplished. During the landing roll, aircraft control was lost. The aircraft ran off the west side of the runway 5,500 feet from the threshold and crossed a drainage ditch to a parallel taxiway and came to a stop 300 feet from the northern most end of the taxiway on a heading of 172 degrees. When the aircraft exited the drainage ditch to the parallel taxiway the nose gear assembly broke at the mounting yoke, the right propeller assembly contacted the ground and separated from the aircraft at the gear reduction assembly, and the fuselage underside, aft of the aft cargo door area, contacted the ground.

The two pilots were not injured, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The aircraft had recently been purchased in Paris, France, and the accident aircraft was on a multi-day flight to bring it to the Friedman Memorial Airport. The previous leg had been from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan to Great Falls, Montana. The previous flights had been without problems or discrepancies, except for an intermittent antiskid problem on the left system and a rather poor braking action noticed during a long taxi after landing in Iqualit.The crew executed a visual approach for a ""flaps 52"" full-stop landing on the 6,602 foot long runway 31. Both crew members reported that the aircraft became established on final at a speed of approximately landing approach speed (Vref) plus 15 knots to Vref plus 20 knots. According to the pilot in command, because of the reported winds, he expected to experience a five to eight knot tailwind at touchdown. He therefore began reducing power on final in order to insure a touchdown ""on the numbers,"" right at Vref speed. According to the first officer, who had about eight times as many flight hours in this model aircraft as the pilot in command, this reduction in power caused the aircraft to establish a descent rate that resulted in a ""firm"" touchdown and a bounced landing. The pilot in command thought that the aircraft had simply bounced hard enough for the gear oleos to extend, but not hard enough for the wheels to come off the ground.He then began the thrust reverser activation/braking process soon after the initial touchdown. Both pilots said that after reverse power was selected they heard a noise associated with engine acceleration, but that it did not sound like they expected it should with the reverser doors in the deployed position. They both also noticed that the aircraft was not slowing as expected. The pilot in command then applied more reverse power and initiated strong braking, but the aircraft still failed to slow. He therefore moved the reverse levers back to the stowed position, after which the first officer physically checked the main thrust levers in the idle position. Because the aircraft did not appear to be slowing and because his attention was focused outside, he again selected reverse power without determining if the TRANS or REV lights had illuminated. Also, at about this same time, because he did not detect the ""strong braking action"" which he had expected and because of the previous antiskid problems, the first officer moved the red parking/override brake handle to the number two/full override position. At this point, the pilot in command continued to apply full toe brake pressure and, since his training had taught him to move the parking brake handle to the number one/mid position during emergencies, he moved the red brake lever from the number two position to the number one detent. Then, because it felt and sounded as if power was being added, and because the aircraft did not appear to be slowing, and maybe even accelerating, the pilot in command moved the red brake lever back to the originally selected number two position. As the aircraft neared the end of the runway, the first officer also began use of the toe brakes, but that resulted in ""... no apparent effect."" The aircraft eventually departed the end of the runway, skidded across open terrain, and passed through a chain-link perimeter fence. It then skidded across Highway 75, experienced a nose gear collapse when it impacted the edge of an asphalt bike path, and ultimately came to rest in a city park.",14:30,2 Garrett TFE731-2-1C,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,8607,,,,,,

The pilot attempted to correct this, but it became impossible to land. At an altitude of 20 m go-around thrust was added and the flaps were retracted. The aircraft continued to sink, whereupon the pilot decided to make forced landing. He pulled back the throttles and landed the plane 1983 m past the beginning of the runway.

The departure and cruise phases were uneventful. During the cruise the commander briefed the co-pilot on the approach to Hong Kong using the airline's own approach briefing proforma as a checklist for the topics to cover. The briefing included the runway-in-use, navigation aids, decision height, crosswind limit and missed approach procedure. He paid particular attention to the crosswind and stated that, should they encounter any problem during the approach, they would go-around and execute the standard missed approach procedure. The commander did not discuss with the co-pilot the autobrake setting, the reverse thrust power setting or their actions in the event of a windshear warning from the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS).Weather reports indicated strong gusty wind conditions, rain and windshear. On establishing radio contact with Hong Kong Approach Control at 03:17, the crew were given radar control service to intercept the IGS approach to runway 13 which is offset from the extended runway centreline by 47°. After intercepting the IGS localiser beam, the pilots changed frequency to Hong Kong Tower and were informed by the AMC that the visibility had decreased to 5 kilometres in rain and the mean wind speed had increased to 22 kt. Two minutes before clearing CAL605 to land, the air traffic controller advised the crew that the wind was 070/25 kt and to expect windshear turning short final.During the approach the pilots completed the landing checklist for a flaps 30 landing with the autobrakes controller selected to position '2' and the spoilers armed. The reference airspeed (Vref) at the landing weight was 141 kt; to that speed the commander added half the reported surface wind to give a target airspeed for the final approach of 153 kt.Rain and significant turbulence were encountered on the IGS approach and both pilots activated their windscreen wipers. At 1,500 feet altitude the commander noted that the wind speed computed by the Flight Management Computer (FMC) was about 50 kt. At 1,100 feet he disconnected the autopilots and commenced manual control of the flightpath. A few seconds later at 1,000 feet he disconnected the autothrottle system because he was dissatisfied with its speed holding performance. From that time onwards he controlled the thrust levers with his right hand and the control wheel with his left hand. Shortly afterwards the commander had difficulty in reading the reference airspeed on his electronic Primary Flying Display (PFD) because of an obscure anomaly, but this was rectified by the co-pilot who re-entered the reference airspeed of 141 kt into the FMC. Shortly before the aircraft started the visual right turn onto short final, the commander saw an amber 'WINDSHEAR' warning on his PFD. A few seconds later, just after the start of the finals turn, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) gave an aural warning of ""GLIDESLOPE"" which would normally indicate that the aircraft was significantly below the IGS glidepath. One second later the aural warning changed to ""WINDSHEAR"" and the word was repeated twice. At the same time both pilots saw the word 'WINDSHEAR' displayed in red letters on their PFDs. Abeam the Checkerboard the commander was aware of uncommanded yawing and pitch oscillations. He continued the finals turn without speaking whilst the co-pilot called deviations from the target airspeed in terms of plus and minus figures related to 153 kt. At the conclusion of the turn both pilots were aware that the aircraft had descended below the optimum flight path indicated by the optical Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) system.The air traffic controller watched the final approach and landing of the aircraft. It appeared to be on or close to the normal glidepath as it passed abeam the tower and then touched down gently on the runway just beyond the fixed distance marks (which were 300 metres beyond the threshold) but within the normal touchdown zone. The controller was unable to see the aircraft in detail after touchdown because of water spray thrown up by it but he watched its progress on the Surface Movement Radar and noted that it was fast as it passed the penultimate exit at A11. At that time he also observed a marked increase in the spray of water from the aircraft and it began to decelerate more effectively.The commander stated that the touchdown was gentle and in a near wings level attitude. Neither pilot checked that the speed brake lever, which was 'ARMED' during the approach, had moved to the 'UP' position on touchdown.A few seconds after touchdown, when the nose wheel had been lowered onto the runway, the co-pilot took hold of the control column with both hands in order to apply roll control to oppose the crosswind from the left. The aircraft then began an undesired roll to the left. Immediately the commander instructed the co-pilot to reduce the amount of applied into-wind roll control. At the same time he physically assisted the co-pilot to correct the aircraft's roll attitude. Shortly after successful corrective action the aircraft again rolled to the left and the commander intervened once more by reducing the amount of left roll control wheel rotation. During the period of unwanted rolling, which lasted about seven seconds, the aircraft remained on the runway with at least the left body and wing landing gears in contact with the surface. After satisfactory aerodynamic control was regained, the co-pilot noticed a message on the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) display showing that the autobrake system had disarmed. He informed the commander that they had lost autobrakes and then reminded him that reverse thrust was not selected. At almost the same moment the commander selected reverse thrust on all engines and applied firm wheel braking using his foot pedals. As the aircraft passed abeam the high speed exit taxiway (A11), the commander saw the end of the runway approaching.At that point both he and the co-pilot perceived that the distance remaining in which to stop the aircraft might be insufficient. At about the same time the co-pilot also began to press hard on his foot pedals. As the aircraft approached the end of the paved surface the commander turned the aircraft to the left using both rudder pedal and nose wheel steering tiller inputs. The aircraft ran off the end of the runway to the left of the centreline. The nose and right wing dropped over the sea wall and the aircraft entered the sea creating a very large plume of water which was observed from the control tower, some 3.5 km to the northwest. The controller immediately activated the crash alarm and the Airport Fire Contingent, which had been on standby because of the strong winds, responded very rapidly in their fire vehicles and fire boats. Other vessels in the vicinity also provided prompt assistance. After the aircraft had settled in the water, the commander operated the engine fuel cut-off switches and the co-pilot operated all the fire handles. The commander attempted to speak to the cabin crew using the interphone system but it was not working. The senior cabin crew member arrived on the flight deck as the commander was leaving his seat to proceed aft. The instruction to initiate evacuation through the main deck doors was then issued by the commander and supervised by the senior cabin crew member from the main deck.",11:36,4 Pratt & Whitney PW4056,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,605,1969,,,,359,,

The aircraft was operated by the Canadian Armed Forces on a crew training flight.During a flapless landing the aircraft was flared too high and the pilot then put the nose down in an attempt to correct the situation. As a result the aircraft touched down very hard, bounced and began to porpoise. The pilot carried out a go-around. It appeared the right hand main gear was damaged in the bounced landing and the airplane entered a holding pattern. After about 40 minutes in the holding pattern, the right main undercarriage suddenly fell away. This was quickly followed by a total loss of power on the right engine and an intense fire in the general area of the right wheel well. The crew immediately directed the plane to Shearwater for an emergency landing. The aircraft landed safely but slid off the side of the runway. The crew were able to exit the aircraft before an explosion occurred in the centre section fuel tank. During the first landing attempt the right undercarriage trunnion structure had been damaged and the undercarriage had broken away to hang from a hydraulic actuator and its associated hydraulic line. This hydraulic line passed over a fuel line near the wheel well transferring the weight of the undercarriage onto the fuel line. After a while the fuel line had failed followed by the hydraulic line and the undercarriage had then fallen free. The failure of the fuel line resulted in the right engine being starved of fuel while leaking fuel, streaming from the rupture, ignited causing the massive fire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intermediate stops were planned at Jos (JOS) and Kaduna (KAD). The Boeing 737 landed at Jos at 07:40 and departed fifty minutes later. The flight to Kaduna was uneventful. Kaduna ATC gave the aircraft an inbound clearance with no delay for a locator approach to runway 05.

He was reminded by the controller that the wind was from 090 magnetic, but he still insisted on using the 23 approach.

The observer in the jump seat also suggested going on the downwind, presumably to re-position the aircraft for landing on runway 05. There was no response at all from the captain and the approach was continued for runway 23. The left turn was very steep and it took the aircraft to the left of the runway centreline and a right correction was applied.

At 3.5nm short of the runway the pilot was asked to confirm that his landing gear was down and locked as is normal procedure at Northolt. After some rephrasing of this question, the landing gear was confirmed down, however during this exchange the aircraft was seen to deviate above the glidepath. At 2.5 nm, landing clearance was confirmed and the aircraft was advised of the surface wind and the fact that there was a 4 kt tailwind. The aircraft was also advised that it was above the glide path.

Light rain was falling at the time the aircraft taxied. The wind was light with a slight crosswind from the right. Visibility was in excess of 10 KM. The runway was damp and there were several patches of water on the runway.The pilot reported that the take-off proceeded normally until approximately 50 knots when he disengaged the nose-wheel steering. At this point, the aircraft started to diverge to the right of the centreline. In an attempt to return the aircraft to the centreline the pilot used rudder but this was ineffective. The pilot then rejected the take-off by moving the power levers to idle but the aircraft continued to diverge to the right and departed the sealed surface of the runway.The pilot used reverse thrust in an attempt to slow the aircraft but this appeared ineffective and the aircraft continued to turn to the right and slide on the wet grass surface. The aircraft by this time was heading for a small levee bank beside a drainage ditch. The pilot assessed that the aircraft would probably climb over the levee bank, so he elected to introduce power on the left engine in an attempt to turn the aircraft before the levee bank. However, this was only partially successful and the aircraft came to rest adjacent to the levee bank facing approximately 180 degrees from the take-off heading. The left propeller contacted the bank as the aircraft stopped. The aircraft had travelled 121 M after leaving the runway. The distance at which the aircraft left the centreline of the runway could not be accurately determined due to the runway surface.

The commander controlled the aircraft with rudder, reversed the engines and braked lightly. He did not notice anything special in the behavior of the aircraft at that point. When - after the speed had become so low that rudder steering was no longer possible - he reverted to nose wheel steering he noticed that it was not functioning. He continued the light wheel braking but could not prevent the aircraft from veering to the right. He then braked fully but the aircraft continued towards the right runway edge.

The aircraft departed from Guernsey at 16:10 for the first sector to Southampton, with the first officer acting as pilot flying (PF). On departure the first officer stated that the aircraft was 'difficult to keep straight' on the runway and moderate turbulence were encountered after takeoff between 500 to 1,000 feet agl but the remainder of the flight was uneventful. The aircraft departed again from Southampton at 17:23, with 50 passengers and 2 kg of freight on board, with the commander as the PF and the first officer as the pilot not flying (PNF).During the cruise the first officer obtained the latest weather for Guernsey: surface wind as 170°/19 gusting to 32 kt, visibility 5 km in rain, cloud scattered at 600 feet, broken at 800 feet, temperature 11°C, dew point 9°C, QNH of 1004 mb with turbulence and windshear below 200 feet agl. The commander briefed the first officer that he intended to carryout a 'radar vectored' ILS approach to runway 27 using 26.5° of flap, instead of the usual 40°, for greater aileron control in the crosswind conditions during the landing. He also intended to add 10 kt to the target threshold speed (TTS).In the final stages of the approach the aircraft experienced a drift angle of 25° to 30° in turbulent conditions. The aircraft was slightly above the prescribed glide path, as it crossed the threshold and the commander stated that when over the runway it was obvious to him that the aircraft would touchdown beyond the normal landing area. He therefore decided to initiate a go-around. Full power was applied and, when established with a positive rate of climb, the landing gear was selected up and the flaps retracted to 16°. The aircraft climbed to 1,500 feet, the flaps were retracted and the crew were given radar vectors for a second ILS approach to runway 27. The commander described the second approach as being more stable and on the correct 3° glide path throughout. The drift angle this time was between 30° and 40° from the inbound track. The crew had correctly calculated the TTS as 96 kt with 40° of flap and 106 kt when using 26.5° of flap. The 40° flap TTS of 96 kt was displayed on the landing data card on the flight deck. The aircraft was cleared to land by ATC approximately three minutes before the actual touchdown. The surface wind was passed as '180°/18 kt with the runway surface wet'. Nineteen seconds before touchdown ATC transmitted the surface wind as '190°/20 kt"".The first officer stated that the indicated airspeed (IAS) had been 120 kt 'down the slope' and 110 kt as the aircraft crossed the threshold. The commander stated that the aircraft crossed the threshold, with 26.5° of flap selected, at the correct height with the projected touchdown point in the normal position. Both pilots stated that during the flare, at a height estimated by the commander to be between 10 to 15 feet above the runway, the aircraft appeared to float. The commander reduced the engine torques to zero. The aircraft then continued to descend and touched down, according to the commander, 'a little beyond the normal point, left main wheel first followed by the right and then the nose wheel'. Several fireman however, who were on standby in their vehicles at the airport fire station, saw the aircraft touch down. They described the touchdown point as being opposite the runway fire access road, i.e. with 750 meters to 900 meters of runway remaining.After touchdown the commander selected ground fine pitch on both engines but neither the first officer, the No 1 cabin attendant, who was seated at the rear of the aircraft, nor several of the passengers were aware of the normal aerodynamic braking noise from the propellers. The first officer selected the flaps up and, with the commander having called 'your stick', applied full left (into wind) aileron. It is normal for the PNF to then call '5 lights (indicating that both propellers were in ground fine pitch), TGTs (turbine gas temperatures) stable and flaps traveling'. The first officer can recall seeing five lights but stated that he did not make the normal call. The commander applied full right rudder and braking; applying maximum braking on the right side to keep the aircraft straight. The first officer describedthe commander as 'standing up in his seat' whilst applying full right rudder.As the aircraft traveled down the runway it felt to the crew as if it was 'skidding or floating with ineffective brakes'. The first officer did not assist with the braking. Sixteen seconds into the ground roll the aircraft started to turn uncontrollably to the left. Realizing that the aircraft would leave the paved surface the commander instructed the first officer to transmit a 'Mayday' message. The aircraft overran the end of the runway and entered the grass to the left of the extended center-line at a speed estimated by the crew to be 60 kt. It then impacted and crossed a narrow earth bank before stopping in an adjacent field.",18:18,2 Rolls-Royce Dart 532-7,,,,,44877,,,,53639,,

Flight 4064 departed at 22:30, some 15 minutes behind the planned schedule. The handling pilot for the sector was the first officer; this was decided during the pre-flight briefing, given the good meteorological conditions expected at destination. As soon as the Ibiza METAR had been obtained, while still in the cruise phase, the first officer planned for an ILS approach to runway 24, set up the navigation aids and programmed the Flight Management Guidance Computers (FMGC's) accordingly. He pre-selected the BSCU (Brake and Steering Control Unit) Autobrake system to Low. Upon this selection, a 'BRAKES BSCU CH 2 FAULT' was annunciated to the crew. There was no ECAM procedure to be followed. The selection was repeated but the fault remained. The Status Page displayed 'Inop Sys BSCU2 Fault' ('Inoperative System, BSCU Channel 2 Fault'). The crew checked the relevant section of the Flight Crew Operating Manual Volume 3 and this stated that the indication was for' Crew Awareness'. No further crew action was specified. At 00:46 hrs the crew were authorised to land on runway 24, wind of 020deg at 5 knots. The aircraft made the flare and a gentle touchdown about 800 metres from the start of runway 24. A slight tailwind component was apparent, of approx. 4 kt. Reverse thrust was selected and initial deceleration appeared normal. The commander considered that more braking was required in order to slow the aircraft to achieve the planned turn off the runway, so he advised the first officer to apply more braking.The first officer tried to apply more braking but found this ineffective. He informed the commander of this and, around 80 kt, the first officer reduced reverse thrust. The commander immediately took control, reapplied reverse thrust and attempted to apply the brakes. He too found that there was no braking available. Therefore, the commander began to swerve the aircraft each way in an attempt to increase the available braking distance and slow the aircraft down by lateral skidding before reaching the end of the runway, with the tyres leaving rubber marks on the runway surface. The aircraft left the end of the runway, entering the paved stopway and then into and beyond the 60 m overrun area. The captain elected to turn the aircraft to the right to remain within the aerodrome boundary. The nose landing gear collapsed as the aircraft ran on softer and more rugged terrain to approach an earth embankment and then came to rest with both engines partially embedded in it.",ca 00:50,2 CFMI CFM56-5A3,,Repaired,,4064,22265,,,,,,

By 06:50 hrs they were in contact with the Aerodrome Flight Information Service Officer (AFISO) at Fairoaks but the AFISO advised the crew not to land until the normal operating time at 07:00 hrs when the airfield would have fire cover available. The current weather was reported to the crew by the AFISO as follows: Sky clear; mist with a visibility of 1,200 metres; surface wind 060° less than 5 kt; QNH 1002 mb and QFE 1005 mb. The commander, who was the handling pilot, approached the airfield on a track of 060° using the Fairoaks Non-directional Radio Beacon (NDB) and the aircraft's Flight Management System (FMS), and descended to 1,000 feet agl with the intention of landing on runway 06. However, neither pilot saw the airfield until they were overhead and, in agreement with the AFISO, decided to make an approach to runway 24 because of better visibility in that direction. The AFISO switched on the Abbreviated Precision Approach Path Indicators (APAPIs) for runway 24 and the commander flew a tear drop pattern to the east of the airfield and then established the aircraft on a track of 240° towards the airfield. During the pattern, the gear had been selected down and the flaps set to an intermediate position. At 1.8 nm DME range, the co-pilot saw the APAPIs slightly left of the aircraft nose and pointed them out to the commander; at the time, the co-pilot recalled that the APAPIs were showing 'two whites', the aircraft was at 1,000 feet agl and at 124 kt IAS. By now, the crew had been advised to land at their discretion with the wind calm. Subsequently, full flap was selected and the commander noted his speed on short finals as 104 kt. As VP-CKM approached the threshold, the commander called for the deployment of speedbrakes; as the co-pilot deployed the speedbrakes, he noted the DME range as 0.5 nm and that the FMS indicated a tailwind of 5 kt. The commander considered that touchdown was positive and just beyond the threshold; the co-pilot considered that touchdown was just past the APAPIs.Immediately after touchdown, the commander selected full thrust reverse on both engines and applied moderate wheel braking. Initially, he considered that the retardation seemed adequate but then seemed to reduce. The co-pilot was not aware of retardation and remembered applying maximum brake pedal pressure while noticing that the runway was damp and seemed ""shiny"".When he realised that he could not stop the aircraft before the end of the runway, the commander stowed the thrust reversers and attempted to close down the engines. During the later part of the landing run, the co-pilot heard a call of ""going round"" and saw the commander stow the thrust reversers.After leaving the runway, the aircraft travelled for 250 metres before coming to rest. The passenger evacuated through the cabin escape hatch and the co-pilot followed him after an unsuccessful attempt to open the normal cabin door. The co-pilot was then able to open the cabin door from the outside and assist the commander to leave. The commander had sustained back injuries and the copilot had received some cuts and bruises.On seeing the aircraft going off the runway, the AFISO alerted the AFS who, because of the misty conditions, had positioned at the threshold of runway 24. The AFS followed the track of VP-CKM and on arrival at the crash scene, where there was a strong smell of fuel with smoke emanating from the engines, covered the aircraft with foam. The AFS moved the aircraft occupants well clear of the wreckage and remained on the scene. Prior to departure, the commander checked the landing distance required for the expected weight of VP-CKM at Fairoaks and calculated that he had 30 to 40 metres longer than required based on zero surface wind. This calculation was subsequently confirmed as reasonable for a landing on runway 24. However, at the time of landing there was a slight tailwind and the runway was not dry.The aircraft had sustained serious damage. The landing gear was torn off, the left wing tip removed, and extensive impact damage to fuselage underside, wings and tail. There was heavy FOD ingestion damage to the right engine.

AirTran mechanics identified the source of the leak as a chafed hydraulic pressure line to the right thrust reverser. The AirTran maintenance controller in Orlando instructed the mechanic to cap the leaking line and deactivate the right thrust reverser in accordance with AirTran's Minimum Equipment List (MEL) procedures. However, instead of capping the hydraulic pressure line, the mechanics capped the right engine hydraulic pump case drain return line. The mechanics performed a leak check by starting the auxiliary power unit and turning on the electric hydraulic pumps to pressurize the airplane's hydraulic systems; no leaks were detected. Although the mechanics were not required by company procedures to test their repair by running the engines, this test would have alerted the mechanics that they had incorrectly capped the hydraulic pump case drain line, which would have overpressurized the hydraulic pump and caused the hydraulic pump case seal to rupture. However, because the mechanics did not perform this test, the overpressure and rupture occurred during the airplane's climb out, allowing depletion of system A hydraulic fluid. The crew notified air traffic control that the airplane would be returning to ATL and subsequently declared an emergency. The flight crew's initial approach to the airport was high and fast because of the workload associated with performing AirTran's procedures for the loss of hydraulic system A and the limited amount of time available to perform the procedures. Nevertheless, the crew was able to configure and stabilize the airplane for landing on runway 09L. However, depletion of system A hydraulic fluid disabled the nosewheel steering, inboard flight spoilers, ground spoilers, and left and right inboard brakes. The flight crew was able to land the airplane using the left thrust reverser (the right thrust reverser was fully functional but intentionally deactivated by the mechanics), outboard brakes (powered by hydraulic system B), and rudder. The flight crew used the left thrust reverser and rudder in an attempt to control the direction of the airplane down the runway, but use of the rudder pedals in this manner had depleted the system A accumulator pressure, which would have allowed three emergency brake applications. The use of the right outboard brake without the right inboard brake at a higher-than-normal speed (Vref for 15-degree flaps is faster than Vref for normal landing flaps) and with heavy gross weight (the airplane had consumed only 4,650 pounds of the 28,500 pounds of fuel on board at takeoff) used up the remaining friction material on the right outboard brake, causing it to fail. (The left outboard brake was still functional at this point.) The lack of brake friction material on the right outboard brake caused one of the right outboard brake pistons to overtravel and unport its o-ring, allowing system B hydraulic fluid to leak out; as a result, the left outboard brake also failed. Loss of the left and right inboard and outboard brakes, loss of nosewheel steering, and use of asymmetric thrust reverse caused the flight crew to lose control of the airplane, which departed the left side of the runway and came to rest in a ditch.",18:48,2 Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,867,45856,,,,49360,,

The co-pilot on the flight was Pilot Flying (PF). While en route, about an hour before arrival, the flight crew listened out the ATIS frequency. The latest report mentioned a visibility of 10 km, a headwind of 15 to 30 kt and rain.When descending towards Biarritz the crew obtained an avoidance heading to bypass a thunderstorm cell. The flight was subsequently cleared for an ILS DME Cat I for runway 27. In the four minutes before landing, the visibility was 1500 metres in a squall, wind 6 kt with gusts to 3 kt, its direction changing from 250° to 290°, with variations up to 330°. The Vref is 129 kt and the Vapp 149 kt. The controller cleared the flight for landing and indicated a wind of 250° at 16 kt, gusts to 30 kt and heavy rain. The first officer disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle at an altitude of approximately 1200 ft, while established on the ILS. As the aircraft descended through 1100 feet, the captain was able to see the runway ahead.On short final, the controller reported a wind of 280° at 15 to 30 kt.The aircraft gradually deviated to the left of the centre line. The captain said: ""a little to the left"". The aircraft then gradually returned to align with the runway centreline.The PF banked the aircraft to the left as it slightly overshot the runway centreline. The aircraft passed the threshold approximately 4 m to the right of the centreline, parallel to it, with its wings horizontal. The PF started the flare with a slight bank to the left. The thrust reduction occured a few seconds later.The left main gear touched the runway first at an indicated airspeed of 148 kt, while the aircraft was 12 m to the left of the runway centreline. The aircraft moved 7 m to the left, rolling on the only left main gear for about two seconds. The PF used the control column and the rudder pedals to steer the airplane to the right. The right main gear touched the runway while the left wheels were about 3 m from the edge of the runway.The PF corrected the trajectory using the rudders, without using the full amplitude. The aircraft exited the runway on the left at a speed of 133 kt. The nose gear struck the concrete support of a light and broke.

The aircraft sustained substantial damage; however, neither of the 2 flight crewmembers nor any of their 12 passengers were injured. The flight originated from Pago Pago, American Samoa, at 06:09 as a regularly scheduled non-stop domestic passenger flight to Fitiuta. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and a composite IFR/VFR flight plan was filed.The captain overflew the Fitiuta airfield to assess winds conditions and the windsock indicated a quartering headwind for runway 12. During rollout the airplane veered immediately right when the power levers were brought into beta. The captain corrected with rudder and braking but was unable to maintain directional control. The aircraft ran off the right side of the runway and collided with a ditch and an embankment. After deplaning, the crew found that the winds were a 60-degree tailwind on runway 12. The windsock's pivot point on the pole was rusted and would not rotate. The aircraft with the same landing weight and a 60-degree 10-knot tailwind would require a 1,600-foot landing roll on the 2,350-foot runway without the assistance of both props in beta.

The left engine had been changed 2 days prior to the accident. As the mechanics finished the beta pin area during engine installation, the inspector checked the area and found that the pin was in place and properly safety wired. Following the inspector's signoff of the area, the mechanics discovered that the teleflex cable was too short for the beta valve to be flushed and subsequently had to be adjusted. The director of maintenance readjusted the cable, which required disturbing the safety wire on the beta pin. One of the two mechanics that had been instructed to re-safety the connections after the adjustment thought that the rear portion had already been safetied and did not recheck the area.

The departure from Baltimore/Washington International Airport, and cruise flight to JFK was uneventful. The captain completed an approach checklist and briefing, and ATC gave the flightcrew a vector for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 4R. Later, ATC advised the flightcrew that the runway visibility range (RVR) was 1,600 feet. The controller asked if the flightcrew could proceed with the approach, or if they were going to have to hold until the RVR was at 1,800 feet. The captain stated that they needed 1,800 feet RVR to initiate the approach. ATC then cleared the flight to turn to 010 degrees and intercept the runway 4R localizer, and hold southwest of the EBBEE intersection, on the localizer, at 4,000 feet. The airplane had not reached EBBEE, but was on the localizer course, when the controller stated, ""Eagle flight nine twenty five, runway four right RVR is eighteen hundred if, if you want to make it from there, or you might be too high. Just let me know..."" The captain replied ""we can take it."" The controller then cleared flight 4925 for the ILS approach to runway 4R. At that time, the airplane was approximately 4,000 feet mean sea level (MSL), and 6.6 miles from the approach end of the runway. The first officer began the approach descent, but the captain extended the landing gear and took control of the airplane. Approximately 24 seconds after issuing the approach clearance, the controller stated, ""Eagle flight nine twenty five, you good for the approach from there?"" The captain replied, ""We're gonna give it our best."" During the descent, the flightcrew received four audible warnings, including one ""sink rate"", and three ""too low terrain"" warnings. According to a Saab 340 manual, a ""too low terrain"" warning would cancel a flap warning. At 0701:12, the first officer stated ""okay, there's three hundred feet."" Approximately 7 seconds later, the captain stated ""okay, before landing checklist is."" The first officer replied ""three green, flaps zero."" During the approach, the first officer made no other callouts. The flaps remained retracted during the approach. However, after the accident, the captain extended the flaps to 20 degrees.The airplane's descent rate reached a maximum vertical velocity of approximately 2,950 feet per minute.

However, the airplane originally intended to be used for the flight was delayed in its arrival to Dallas/Fort Worth because of adverse weather in the area. After 21:00, the first officer notified gate agents that flight 1420 would need to depart by 23:16 because of Americans company duty time limitation. Another aircraft was arranged and the flight departed at 22:40.  En route and Descent About 22:54, the flight dispatcher sent the flight crew an ACARS message indicating that the weather around Little Rock might be a factor during the arrival. The dispatcher suggested that the flight crew expedite the arrival to beat the thunderstorms if possible, and the flight crew acknowledged this message. About 23:04, the Fort Worth center broadcast an NWS Convective SIGMET [significant meteorological information] weather advisory for an area of severe thunderstorms that included the Little Rock airport area. The flight crew discussed the weather and the need to expedite the approach. At 23:25:47, the captain stated, ""we got to get over there quick."" About 5 seconds later, the first officer said, ""I dont like that...thats lightning,"" to which the captain replied, ""sure is."" The flight crew had the city of Little Rock and the airport area in sight by 23:26. Fort Worth center cleared the flight to descend to 10,000 feet msl. The flight was transferred to the Memphis ARTCC and at 23:34, the flight crew contacted the Little Rock Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). The controller advised the flight crew that a thunderstorm located northwest of the airport was moving through the area and that the wind was 280º at 28 knots gusting to 44 knots. The first officer told the controller that he and the captain could see the lightning. The controller told the flight crew to expect an ILS approach to runway 22L. At 23:36, the captain and first officer discussed American Airlines crosswind limitation for landing. The captain indicated that 30 knots was the crosswind limitation but realized that he had provided the limitation for a dry runway. The captain then stated that the wet runway crosswind limitation was 20 knots, but the first officer stated that the limitation was 25 knots. At 23:39:00, the controller cleared the flight to descend to an altitude of 3,000 feet msl. The controller then asked the flight crew about the weather conditions along the runway 22L final approach course, stating his belief that the airplanes weather radar was ""a lot better"" than the weather radar depiction available in the tower. At 23:39:12, the first officer stated, ""okay, we can...see the airport from here. We can barely make it out but we should be able to make [runway] two two...that storm is moving this way like your radar says it is but a little bit farther off than you thought."" The controller then offered flight 1420 a visual approach to the runway, but the first officer indicated, ""at this point, we really cant make it out. Were gonna have to stay with you as long as possible."" At 23:39:45, the controller notified flight 1420 of a windshear alert, reporting that the centerfield wind was 340º at 10 knots, the north boundary wind was 330º at 25 knots, and the northwest boundary wind was 010º at 15 knots. The flight crew then requested runway 04R so that there would be a headwind, rather than a tailwind, during landing. At 23:40:20, the controller instructed the flight crew to fly a heading of 250º for vectors to the runway 04R ILS final approach course. After reaching the assigned heading, the airplane was turned away from the airport and clear of the thunderstorm that had previously been reported by the controller. Between 23:40:46 and 23:41:31, the first officer stated the localizer frequency and course, the decision altitude, the minimum safe altitude, and a portion of the missed approach procedure for runway 04R. The captain then asked the first officer, ""do you have the airport? Is that it right there? I dont see a runway."" At 23:42:27, the controller told the flight crew that the second part of the thunderstorm was apparently moving through the area and that the winds were 340º at 16 knots gusting to 34 knots. At 23:42:40, the first officer asked the captain whether he wanted to accept ""a short approach"" and ""keep it in tight."" The captain answered, ""yeah, if you see the runway. cause I dont quite see it."" The first officer stated, ""yeah, its right here, see it?"" The captain replied, ""you just point me in the right direction and Ill start slowing down here."" At 23:42:55, the first officer said, ""its going right over the...field."" The first officer then told the controller, ""well we got the airport. Were going between clouds. I think its right off my, uh, three oclock low, about four miles."" The controller then offered a visual approach for runway 04R, and the first officer accepted. At 23:43:11, the controller cleared flight 1420 for a visual approach to runway 04R and indicated ""if you lose it, need some help, let me know please."" At 23:43:35, the first officer stated, ""youre comin in. Theres the airport."" Three seconds later, the captain stated, ""uh, I lost it,"" to which the first officer replied, ""see its right there."" The captain then stated, ""I still dont see it...just vector me. I dont know."" At 23:43:59, the controller cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the winds were 330º at 21 knots. At 23:44:19, the captain stated, ""see were losing it. I dont think we can maintain visual."" At 23:44:30, the first officer informed the controller that visual contact with the airport had been lost because of a cloud between the airplane and the airport. The controller then cleared the airplane to fly a heading of 220º for radar vectors for the ILS approach to runway 04R and directed the flight to descend to and maintain 2,300 feet msl. At 23:45:47, the first officer told the controller ""were getting pretty close to this storm. well keep it tight if we have to."" The controller indicated to the flight crew that, ""when you join the final, youre going to be right at just a little bit outside the marker if thats gonna be okay for ya."" The captain stated, ""thats great,"" and the first officer told the controller, ""thats great with us."" At 23:46:39, the controller advised the flight crew that the airplane was 3 miles from the outer marker. At 23:46:52, the captain stated, ""aw, were goin right into this."" At the same time, the controller reported that there was heavy rain at the airport, the ATIS information in effect at the time was no longer current, the visibility was less than 1 mile, and the runway visual range (RVR) for runway 04R was 3,000 feet. The first officer acknowledged this information.  Final approach At 23:47:08, the controller again cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the wind was 350º at 30 knots gusting to 45 knots. The first officer then read back the wind information as 030º at 45 knots. At 23:47:22, the captain stated, ""three thousand RVR. We cant land on that."" Four seconds later, the first officer indicated that the RVR for runway 04R was 2,400 feet, and the captain then said, ""okay, fine."" At 23:47:44, the captain stated, ""landing gear down."" About 5 seconds later, the captain stated, ""and lights please."" At 23:47:53, the controller issued a second windshear alert for the airport, reporting that the centerfield wind was 350º at 32 knots gusting to 45 knots, the north boundary wind was 310º at 29 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320º at 32 knots. This transmission was not acknowledged by the flight crew. At 23:48:10, the captain stated, ""add twenty [knots],"" to which the first officer replied, ""right."" At 23:48:12, the controller reported that the runway 04R RVR was now 1,600 feet. About 23:48:18, the captain indicated that the flight was established on final approach; 6 seconds later, the first officer informed the controller that the flight was established on the inbound portion of the ILS. The controller repeated the clearance to land; stated that the wind was 340º at 31 knots, the north boundary wind was 300º at 26 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320º at 25 knots; and repeated the RVR. At 23:48:41, the first officer acknowledged this information. The controller did not receive any further transmissions from flight 1420. At 23:49:02, the first officer asked the captain, ""want forty flaps?"" The captain indicated that he thought he had already called for the landing flaps, after which the first officer stated, ""forty now."" At 23:49:10, the controller informed the flight crew that the wind was 330º at 28 knots. Two seconds later, the captain stated, ""this is a can of worms."" The first officer stated, ""theres the runway off to your right, got it?"" at 23:49:24. The captain replied, ""no,"" to which the first officer stated, ""I got the runway in sight. Youre right on course. Stay where youre at."" The captain then stated, ""I got it. I got it."" At 23:49:32, the controller reported the wind to be 330º at 25 knots. At 23:49:53, the controller reported the wind to be 320º at 23 knots. From about 400 feet above field level (afl) the airplane drifted to the right. At 23:50:00, the first officer said, ""were way off."" The localizer deviation value was about one dot to the right at that point. About 1 second later, the captain stated, ""I cant see it."" About 3 seconds afterward, the first officer asked, ""got it?"" to which the captain replied, ""yeah I got it."" At 23:50:13 and :14, the GPWS radio altitude callout ""sink rate"" sounded.  Landing The airplane touched down on the runway about 23:50:20. About 23:50:22, the first officer stated ""were down;"" about 2 seconds later, he stated, ""were sliding."" Over a 7-second period after touchdown, both thrust reversers were deployed and the left and right engines engine pressure ratios (EPR) reached settings of 1.89 and 1.67, respectively. The thrust reversers were subsequently moved to the unlocked status (neither deployed nor stowed). The flight spoilers did not deploy symmetrically at touchdown. About the time that the brakes were applied, the thrust reversers were deployed again. At 23:50:32, the CVR recorded an unidentified voice in the cockpit stating ""on the brakes."" The left engine reached a maximum setting of 1.98 reverse EPR, and the right engine reached a setting of 1.64 reverse EPR. The left brake pedal was relaxed at 23:50:34 before returning to its full position 2 seconds later. About the time that the left brake pedal was relaxed, the reversers were returned to the unlocked status. As the right thrust reverser was being moved to the unlocked status, the right engine reached a maximum setting of 1.74 reverse EPR. At 23:50:36, a full aileron deflection was given. At 23:50:40, the left thrust reverser was moved back to the deployed position, but the right reverser moved briefly to the deployed position and then moved to the stowed position. According to FDR data, the left thrust reverser remained deployed, and the right thrust reverser remained stowed, for the remainder of the flight. After departing the end of the runway, the airplane struck several tubes extending outward from the left edge of the instrument landing system localizer array, located 411 feet beyond the end of the runway; passed through a chain link security fence; went down a rock embankment to a flood plain, located approximately 15 feet below the runway elevation; and collided with the structure supporting the runway 22L approach lighting system.",23:51,2 Pratt & Whitney JT8D-217C,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),80 m (262 feet) amsl,AA1420,49136,,,,27103,,

The airplane had been previously positioned to Windsor Locks-Bradley International Airport (BDL), Connecticut, for maintenance work. The flight crew was instructed by dispatch personnel to fly the airplane from BDL, to IAD, and pick up two passengers. According to the captain, the flight departed IAD, and proceeded uneventfully to HYA. While being vectored for the runway 24 ILS approach, with the flaps selected to 20 degrees and the landing gear retracted, the airplane was turned to intercept the localizer. The captain said he called for the extension of the landing gear and ""flaps down."" The landing gear extended and three green lights were confirmed. The flaps moved to what ""appeared"" to be a full down indication. As the landing checklist was being completed, the left and right amber HYDR PRESS lights flickered. The captain stated that he checked the hydraulic pressure indicator, and noted that it still remained at the normal level. The flight crew reported to Cape Approach Control that they had a hydraulic problem and continued on the approach. The left and right amber HYDR PRESS lights began to flash with more regularity and the flight crew discussed whether to continue or divert to another airport. A check of the hydraulic pressure indicator by the captain revealed that the level was at 1,000 PSI, which was ""the bottom of the green arc."" The captain also stated that, in preparation for landing, he pulled the emergency brake lever out of its detent.The flight continued to the airport, and the airplane ""broke out"" of the clouds about 800 feet above the ground. The captain stated that, at a point prior to touchdown, the flight crew was ""alerted to windshear"" and the airspeed climbed to 160 knots. The captain corrected and continued. The flight crew estimated that the airplane touched down within the first 300 feet of the runway. The captain applied normal braking, but the brakes did not respond. The captain then immediately reached for and tried to apply emergency braking, but the emergency brake lever would not move. The captain then requested that the first officer apply emergency braking. The first officer used both of his hands to free the lever and began to apply the emergency brakes. The captain stated that after regaining braking authority, there was not enough remaining runway to stop. The airplane proceeded off the departure end of runway 24, struck a localizer antenna array, and came to rest in a fence.",22:24,,,Repaired,,,4294,,,,,,

The flight originated from Pueblo, Colorado, the same day, about 20:18.While enroute from Pueblo, Colorado, to Columbia, South Carolina, the captain's windshield delaminated, and the flight diverted to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for repairs. The first officer was flying the airplane and had been instructed by the captain to make a firm landing at Fort Lauderdale to get the airplanes weight on the wheels, due to the airplane being light. The landing was firm and the first officer activated the engine thrust reversers. As the nose landing gear touched down, the airplane began veering to the left. Attempts to control the veer to the left were unsuccessful and the airplane ran off the left side of the runway. The airplane then ran over a taxiway and collided with a taxiway sign and the concrete base for the sign. The nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest. Examination of the runway showed alternating dark and light marks from the left main landing gear tire were present on the runway about 160 feet before marks from the right main landing gear tire are present.

Weather in the Hong Kong area was very poor with a severe tropical storm ('Sam') 50 km NE of the airport and gale force winds and thunderstorms. Extra fuel was carried, because the crew intended to continue to Taipei, depending on weather at Hong Kong on arrival. Before the arrival of flight 642 four flights carried out missed approaches, five planes diverted and 12 planes landed successfully. Weather information obtained by the crew at 18:06 reported a 300deg wind at 35 knots and an RVR of 650 m in heavy rain. The flight crew then prepared for a runway 25L ILS approach. Landing reference speed was calculated to be 152 knots and the captain (pilot-in-command) would fly the approach at 170 knots and would continue to land depending on a wind check on finals.At 18:41, while flying the runway 25L ILS approach, weather was reported to the crew being 1600 m visibility in the touchdown zone, wind 320deg/25 knots gusting to 33 knots. The aircraft was then cleared to land. At an altitude of 700 feet prior to touchdown a further wind check was passed to the crew: 320deg/28 knots gusting to 36 knots. Maximum crosswind component limit for the aircraft was 24 knots. The pilot-in-command continued with the approach, disconnected the autopilot but left auto throttle engaged. The MD-11, with a weight very close to the maximum landing weight permitted, stabilized slightly low on the glide slope. At 50 feet above the runway, upon power reduction to flight idle, the airspeed decreased from 170 to 152 knots. An attempt was made to flare in a slightly right wing down (less than 4 deg) attitude. The aircraft landed hard on its right main gear and the no. 3 engine touched the runway. The right main gear separated and the right wing separated. The MD-11 then rolled inverted as it skidded off the runway in flames. It came to rest on a grass area next to the runway, 1100 m from the runway threshold. The right wing was found on a taxiway 90 m from the nose of the plane.The crash sequence in this case bears similarities to a Fedex MD-11 which also flipped upside down on landing at Newark.",18:43,3 Pratt & Whitney PW4460,,,,642,30721,,,,5824,,

The crew contacted Gerona ATC at 23:14 hours. With a thunderstorm in the area, flight conditions were turbulent. ATC offered the option of a runway 20 ILS approach, but the crew decided to fly a VOR/DME procedure to runway 02 considering the prevailing conditions of wet runway, downslope and tailwind. At 23:33, in full landing configuration and just after passing 10 DME, the crew were advised of a change of wind to 200 degrees at 12 knots. Upon becoming visual the aircraft was not adequately aligned with the runway and the change in wind direction now favored the reciprocal runway so a missed approach was carried out. The aircraft was now positioned for an ILS approach to runway 20. During the approach the crew noted that the company minimum amount of fuel for a diversion to Barcelona (2,800 kg) had been reached. At 23:46:58 hrs, at 250 feet above ground level (agl) and on the correct glidepath, the captain disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle. The aircraft began to deviate above the glidepath. Twelve seconds later, at 110 feet agl, the captain briefly pushed the control column almost fully forward before returning it to an approximately neutral position. The aircraft pitched down to -4.5° nose down attitude and then back up to -2.5° nose down attitude. During this period the captain lost his visual reference with the runway because all runway lights had suddenly failed. The GPWS then warned of the excessive sink rate and the thrust levers being retarded to idle. At 21:47:17 the aircraft touched down in a 2° nose down attitude and a recorded peak normal (vertical) acceleration of 3.11 g. The aircraft bounced, the nose pitched up to +3.3°, a roll to the right commenced, both the thrust levers advanced and the power on both engines increased to 1.18 EPR. Full nose down elevator was applied and held until a second touchdown, resulting in a rapid pitch down. The aircraft made the second touchdown 1.9 seconds after the first at -0.5° pitch attitude (nose down), with a pitch rate of 7°/sec nose down and 4.2° of right roll. After a run of approximately 343 meters across flat grassland beside the runway, the aircraft ran diagonally over a substantial earth mound adjacent to the airport boundary, becoming semi-airborne as a result. At the far side of the mound a number of medium sized trees were struck and severed, predominantly by the right wing, and the right engine nacelle struck the boundary fence. The aircraft, yawed considerably to the right of its direction of travel, then passed through the fence, re-landed in a field and both main landing gears collapsed. It came to rest after a 244 meter slide across the field, with the fuselage almost structurally severed at two points.One passenger who was initially admitted to hospital with minor injuries was discharged the following day. He died five days later as a result of unsuspected internal injuries.",23:47,2 Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4,,,,BY226A,26429,,,,9816,,

At 2240, a special weather observation taken at Bangkok airport noted visibility as 1,500 m and the RVR for runway 21R as 750 m.

At 2244:53, the tower controller advised that the runway was wet and that a preceding aircraft (which landed at approximately 2240) reported that braking action was good.The Qantas 1 crew noted no effect from the weather until visibility reduced when the aircraft entered very heavy rain as it descended through 200 feet on late final approach. The aircraft then started to deviate above the 3.15 degree glideslope, passing over the runway threshold at 169 knots at a height of 76 feet. Those parameters were within company limits. (The target speed for the final approach was 154 knots, and the ideal threshold crossing height was 44 ft.)When the aircraft was approximately 10 feet above the runway, the captain instructed the first officer to go around. As the first officer advanced the engine thrust levers, the aircrafts mainwheels touched down (1,002 m along the 3,150 m runway, 636 m beyond the ideal touchdown point). The captain immediately cancelled the go-around by retarding the thrust levers, without announcing his actions. Those events resulted in confusion amongst the other pilots, and contributed to the crew not selecting (or noticing the absence of) reverse thrust during the landing roll. Due to a variety of factors associated with the cancellation of the go-around, the aircrafts speed did not decrease below the touchdown speed (154 kts) until the aircraft was 1,625 m or halfway down the runway.The investigation established that, during the landing roll, the aircraft tyres aquaplaned on the water-affected runway. This limited the effectiveness of the wheelbrakes to about one third of that for a dry runway. In such conditions and without reverse thrust, there was no prospect of the crew stopping the aircraft in the runway distance remaining after touchdown. The aircraft overran the 100 m stopway (at the end of the runway) at a speed of 88 knots, before stopping 220 m later with the nose resting on an airport perimeter road.The depth of water on the runway when the aircraft landed could not be determined but it was sufficient to allow dynamic aquaplaning to occur (i.e. at least 3 mm). The water buildup was the result of heavy rain on the runway in the preceding minutes, and possibly because the runway was ungrooved.During the examination of the performance of the aircraft on the runway, it became evident that the flaps 25/idle reverse thrust landing procedure used by the crew (and which was the preferred company procedure) was not appropriate for operations on to water-affected runways. The appropriate approach/landing procedure was flaps 30/full reverse thrust. This had the characteristics of a lower approach speed, of being easier to fly in terms of speed control and runway aim point (for most company pilots), and of providing maximum aerodynamic drag after touchdown when the effectiveness of the wheelbrakes could be reduced because of aquaplaning. Had this configuration been used, the overrun would most probably have been avoided.As with other company B747-400 pilots, the crew had not been provided with appropriate procedures and training to properly evaluate the potential effect the Bangkok Airport weather conditions might have had on the stopping performance of the aircraft. In particular, they were not sufficiently aware of the potential for aquaplaning and of the importance of reverse thrust as a stopping force on water-affected runways.",22:47,4 Rolls-Royce RB211-524G,,Repaired,,1,41151,,,,6002,,

The crew flew a runway 23 ILS approach with a Decision Altitude (DA) of 465 feet (200 agl). This meant a 2 to 3 kt tailwind. The target speed for the approach was 105 kt with a Vref for landing of 95 kt. The aircraft settled slightly high on the glidepath with the airspeed at 120 kt, and these conditions remained until decision height. At about 300 feet agl the commander could see the approach lights and declared his intention to land. At 200 feet agl, with the speed remaining at 120 kt, the aircraft was still above the ILS glidepath and the first officer sought to bring this to the commander's attention with a call of 'four whites', indicating that the Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPIs) were showing the aircraft to be high on the 3 deg. approach path. The captain decided to minimise the landing flare to reduce any float. The aircraft touched down in a flat attitude at 114 kt (Vref plus 19 kt) approximately 600 metres along the runway with 1,000 metres of runway remaining. Both pilots recalled a lack of retardation in the first part of the landing roll. When the commander realised that stopping on the remaining runway would be difficult he applied maximum braking, but retardation remained low. At a groundspeed of approximately 60 kt the aircraft left the paved surface just to the left of the runway centreline on a track toward the ILS localizer aerial. To avoid hitting the aerial, the pilot steered the aircraft to the right, in the course of which the nosewheel impacted a slight ridge formed by the concrete plinth of a small ILS monitor aerial. The force of the impact with the ridge collapsed the nose landing gear backwards. The aircraft then skidded across the grass on its mainwheels and the nose gear doors before impacting the airfield perimeter fence and coming to a halt with the nose section protruding across a minor road.",06:08,2 Rolls-Royce Dart 532-7,,Repaired,,,,,,,,,

However, by turning the wheel harder and intermittently and using differential braking, he was able to steer the aircraft on the ground. The flight crew therefore decided to continue the flight. On the approach to LG-4, the sky was obscured at 800 feet, visibility was 1 mile in light snow showers, and surface wind was from the west at 5 to 7 knots. Landing on runway 09 would decrease the flight time, and the maximum allowable tailwind on landing specified in the Flight Manual would not be exceeded, so the flight crew elected to make a downwind landing on runway 09. The aircraft touched down approximately 800 feet beyond the runway threshold. As soon as the nose wheel touched down, the captain set the propellers to reverse pitch. Shortly afterward, the aircraft started to drift to the right. The captain tried to correct by braking and applying full left rudder while setting the propellers to reverse pitch asymmetrically, but the aircraft continued its course and exited the south side of runway 09. The aircraft exited the runway at approximately 50 knots and went down a slope to a point about seven feet below the level of the runway surface.

No notable events occurred on the flight until the approach. At 23:24 the captain started the arrival briefing and mentioned the following items: frequency, description of missed approach. He then asked the co-pilot to find out about the weather. The controller transmitted the 23:00 information, mentioning a 080°/5 kt wind, occasionally 340°/15 kt, with gusts to 25 kt. He also mentioned rain showers, some cumulonimbus and indicated that the runway was wet. During the descent, numerous thunderstorm cells were observed by the crew on the track and around the aerodrome. At 23:46, the tower controller asked the flight to descend towards 2,500 ft QNH and to report back when passing OVINI. He stated that there were showers at the aerodrome. Twenty-two seconds later, the co-pilot announced that they were passing OVINI.At 23:49 the captain armed the spoilers and asked for the flaps to be extended to 22° then, twenty-five seconds later, to the 35° position.The controller cleared flight HAL 481 to land on runway 04. He gave the wind as 060°/10 kt, gusting to 14. The captain noticed changes in the wind and the co-pilot announced, based on the airplane's GFMS, a wind from 280° at 28 kt. Almost two minutes later the controller transmitted updated weather information: 330°/18 kt, gusting to 28. Thirty-two seconds later, the crew had the airfield in sight and a final wind reading was given to them: 330°/18 kt, gusting to 29.At 23:52:11, the autopilot was disconnected. Nine seconds later, the airplane passed under the approach path and the GPWS ""sink rate"" warning sounded. The pilot rejoined the descent path with the aid of the PAPI and continued his approach using external visual references. At that time, the airplane was following a track parallel and to the right of the approach path. Between 23:52:32 and 23:52:38, the radio altimeter call-outs between fifty and ten feet began and continued at a rate of one per second. Power reduction began five seconds after the ten feet call-out. At 23:52:45 s, the wheels of the main landing gear touched the runway to the right of the centerline. Five seconds later, which was two seconds after the nose gear touched down, the thrust reversers were deployed. The parameters indicate that reverse thrust on each of the engines was adjusted and regulated without it ever reaching its maximum value. At 23:52:53, eight seconds after the main landing gear touched down, the spoilers were deployed manually by the flight engineer. At 23:52:59, the copilot's ""Centerline"" call-out suggested the captain rejoin the runway centerline, from which the airplane was moving away to the left. At 23:53:21, the airplane crushed the localizer antennae, continued along the runway extended centerline and then came to a stop past the end of the runway, its nose in a lagoon. The captain , after checking on the safety situation around the airplane, ordered the evacuation via door 2R.",23:55,3 General Electric CF6-6K,,Repaired,,481,64841,,Hawaiian Airlines,American Airlines,,,

Following the collision, the airplane continued down the runway with the tires smoking, veered off the right side of the runway near the end, crossed a taxiway, impacted into a ditch and burst into flames. After the accident, the captain and first officer both reported that the thrust reversers failed to operate after they were deployed during the landing.Examination of the landing gear found all three gear collapsed. The right and left main tires had areas of rubber that were worn completely through. The flaps were found extended, and both thrust reversers were found in the stowed position. Examination of the cockpit found the throttles in the idle position, and the thrust reverser levers in the stowed position.Aircraft performance calculations indicate that the airplane traveled 1,500 feet down the runway after touchdown, in 4.2 seconds, before striking the deer. The calculations also indicate that the airplane landed with a ground speed of 124 knots. At 124 knots and maximum braking applied, the airplane should have come to a complete stop in about 850 feet. However, investigation of the accident site and surrounding area revealed heavy black skid marks beginning at the first taxiway turnoff about 1,500 feet down the 5,010 foot runway. The skid marks continued for about 2,500 feet, departed the right side of the runway and proceeded an additional 500 feet over grass and dirt.The investigation revealed that deer fur was found lodged in the squat switch on the left main landing gear, likely rendering the squat switch inoperative after the impact with the deer, and prior to the airplanes loss of control on the runway. Since a valid signal from the squat switch is required for thrust reverser deployment, the loss of this signal forced the thrust reversers to stow. At this point, the electronic engine control (EEC) likely switched to the forward thrust schedule and engine power increased to near takeoff power, which led to the airplane to continue down the runway, and off of it.",13:45,2 Pratt & Whitney Canada PW305A,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,2325,,,,,,

The airplane traveled approximately 700 feet off the end of the runway where it came to rest in the muddy terrain. An emergency evacuation was performed during which the L2 evacuation slide did not deploy. During the investigation, NTSB determined that the airplane was loaded so that its center of gravity (CG), although within limits, was in the aft region of the permissible range. Further, the flight crew had incorrectly set the trim for the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) at -1.7°UP (airplane nose up). This setting resulted in a pitch-up trim condition. The proper trim setting, 1.7°DN (airplane nose down), would have resulted in a correct trim condition for the way the airplane was loaded.

At 05:45, the aircraft departed Halifax for St. John's. The pilot flying was completing his line indoctrination training after having recently upgraded to captain. En route the crew were advised of a NOTAM that the ILS for runway 11 was unserviceable. Because of the marginal weather, the loss of runway 11/29, and his greater experience, the training captain decided to switch seats and assume the duties and full responsibilities as captain and pilot flying.Clearance for an ILS approach to runway 16 was obtained from Gander ACC, and the crew was advised to contact St. John's tower. Just over two minutes before landing, the tower advised that the wind was 050° (estimated) at 20, gusting to 35, knots. The aircraft crossed the final approach fix on the ILS glideslope at 150 KIAS. During the final approach, the airspeed steadily increased to 180 KIAS (ground speed 190 knots); the glidepath was maintained with a descent rate of 1000 feet per minute. From 1000 feet above sea level, no airspeed calls were made; altitude calls were made and responses were made. The Royal Boeing 737 operations manual states that the PNF shall call out significant deviations from programmed airspeed. In the descent, through 900 feet above sea level, the aircraft encountered turbulence resulting in uncommanded roll and pitch deviations and airspeed fluctuations of ±11 knots. At about 300 feet above decision height, the crew acquired visual references for landing. They were cleared to land. The aircraft touched down at 164 KIAS (27 KIAS above the desired touchdown speed of Vref), 2300 to 2500 feet beyond the threshold. The wind at this point was determined to be about 050° at 30 knots. Shortly after touchdown, the speed brakes and thrust reversers were deployed. With approximately 1100 feet of runway remaining, through a speed of 64 KIAS, reverse thrust increased to about 1.97 EPR on engine 1 and 2.15 EPR on engine 2. As the aircraft approached the end of the runway, the captain attempted to steer the aircraft to the right, toward the Delta taxiway intersection. Twenty-two seconds after touchdown, the aircraft exited the departure end of the runway into deep snow. The aircraft came to rest approximately 75 feet beyond and 53 feet to the right of the runway centreline.The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident.

The transport airplane sustained substantial damage during landing when it veered off the left side of runway 27 at 0111 CST and both engines sustained foreign object damage (FOD). Level 4 and 5 thunderstorms were in the vicinity of the airport at the time of the accident. The ASOS rain gauge on the airport indicated 0.42 inches of rain fell between 01:00 and 01:11. The wind was from the northwest at less than 10 knots, and no significant low-level windshear was present at the time of the accident. The first officer was the flying pilot.The Flight Data Recorder data indicated the airplane was on a stabilized instrument approach with the autopilot engaged until about 200 feet above ground level (agl), when the autopilot was disconnected and the airplane was flown manually. After the autopilot disconnect, the airplane began drifting left and above glide slope. The airplane crossed the runway threshold at about 57 feet agl, offset about 65 feet left of centerline, but the ground track was being corrected back toward centerline. A flare was initiated about 600 feet past the runway threshold and about 35 feet agl. During the flare, the ground track achieved the centerline, but deviated back to the left before main gear touchdown, which occurred about 3,200 feet past the runway threshold. At touchdown, the left main gear was about 56 feet left of centerline with an airplane ground track of about 5 degrees to the left. Within 2 seconds of touchdown (about 300 feet of travel), the left main gear crossed the white runway edge strip, and within 5 seconds of touchdown (about 1,000 feet of travel), the left main gear departed the paved surface. A nearly full right rudder input was made at about 3,450 feet from the runway threshold after main gear touchdown.

The first officer was pilot flying on the flight to Skien. A descent for an LLZ/DME (non-precision) approach to runway 19 at Skien was initiated. During the descent through the clouds down to Geiteryggen, some ice formed on the wings. This was noted by the captain at 15 DME. At a distance of 8 DME, while descending through about 3050 feet, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GWPS) sounded and warned: ""Terrain... terrain. Pull up ... pull up."" The captain told the first officer: ""Just easy, easy, easy ... easy that is all right"" and warned him not to descend too fast. The same thing happened at 7 DME and also at 6 DME when the plane was about 100 feet too low in relation to the approach procedure. The first officer began to climb and the captain now shouted: ""Are you climbing? You are going to 2,200 ft Sir. Dont start to f.... it up again now (first officers name)."" As a result of the climb, the aircraft passed the locator Myra (MR) at an altitude of 2,800 ft, around 600 ft too high, and the descent to D3 was steep. The tone in the cockpit was strained and the Commander began to give orders to the first officer. With three miles to go the gear was selected down but the captain expressed his doubts: ""We never gonna make this... Come on, go down, go down. Stay on the localizer, stay onthe localizer."" The aircraft maintained an indicated speed of approx. 110-115 kt when the aircraft encountered an abnormally high sink rate and hit the runway at 6g. The landing led to permanent deformation of the left wing on the forward wing beam. As a result of this deformation, the left landing gear leg was bent backwards, with the engine and propeller pointing obliquely downwards. The left propeller touched the runway and the crew lost directional control so the aircraft skewed out to the left and left the runway. It continued, skidding in an arc to the left, crossed a taxiway twice and hit a gravel bank with great force. The gravel bank was hit by the nose of the aircraft and the left propeller at an assumed angle of 45° in the horizontal plane. The aircraft continued up the gravel bank in a virtually horizontal attitude while the tail was thrown out to the right.

Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The two flight crew members and four passengers were uninjured. The captain, who was also the company chief pilot and check airman, was the flying pilot, and the first officer was the non flying pilot. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. Area weather reporting stations reported the presence of freezing rain and snow for a time period beginning several hours before the accident. The captain did not obtain the destination airport weather observation until the flight was approximately 30 nautical miles from the airport. The flight received radar vectors for a instrument landing system approach to runway 30 (5,401 feet by 100 feet, grooved asphalt). The company's training manual states the MU-300's intermediate and final approach speeds as 140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and Vref, respectively. Vref was reported by the flight crew as 106 KIAS. During the approach, the tower controller gave the option for the flight to circle to land or continue straight in to runway 30. He advised that the winds were from 050-070 degrees at 10 knots gusting to 20 knots, and runway braking action was reported as fair to poor by a snow plow. Radar data indicates that the airplane had a ground speed in excess of 200 knots between the final approach fix and runway threshold and a full-scale localizer deviation 5.5 nm from the localizer antenna. The aircraft appeared to be decelerating normal, according to the captain, until approximately the 3,000 foot marker. At that point the aircraft's deceleration slowed down and the aircraft began to skid. Approaching the end of the runway the captain noticed a drop off at beyond the end of the runway. The visibility was not good enough to determine what was beyond the drop-off. The captain decided to turn the aircraft to minimize the forward speed after exiting runway and to avoid going down the hill. The aircraft came to rest 30 feet beyond the departure end to the right of centerline.The company did not have stabilized approach criteria establishing when a missed approach or go-around is to be executed. The captain stated that he was unaware that there was 0.7 percent downslope on runway 30. The company provided a page from their airport directory which did not indicate a slope present for runway 30.",09:01,,,,,,4078,,,,,,

The first landing was made with the left engine simulated inoperative. After that, during a landing with the right engine simulated inoperative, the touch down was late and the trainee pilot attempted to go-around with go-around thrust on the left engine only. A few seconds later the instructor increased power on the right engine to go-around thrust, but at that time even though the left engine thrust had started to increase the right engine was still at minimum idle thrust. As a result, a thrust imbalance occurred between the left and right engines while right rudder was being applied, and the aircraft rolled and yawed to the right.

The water ballast tanks were not filled, causing the centre of gravity to be outside the allowed limits. After passing the outer marker on approach to runway 26, a 15-second period of oscillations started with changes in bank angle and heading (between 245 and 255 degrees). The plane passed over the runway threshold at a height of 30 m and at a speed of 293 km/h. At this point the altitude should have been 15 m. At a height of 20 m, at a speed of 297 km/h, the thrust reversers of the no. 1 and 4 engines were deployed. This was contrary to regulations, which stipulate that thrust reversers may only be deployed at the leveling-off altitude of 5-8 m. The nose then rose to a 7-degreee pitch angle. This was caused by the activation of the thrust reversers and the centre of gravity which was too far aft. The pitch-up could not be countered by a 13-degree nose down elevator application. The plane finally touched down on the maingear wheels 1395 m down the 4200 m long runway. The flight engineer, without telling the pilot in command, shut down the no. 2 and 3 engines. With an elevator-down deflection of 10-11 degrees and the stabilizer at -3.3 degrees the crew were still not able to get the nose gear on the ground. After retracting the thrust reversers and with the elevator deflected in a 21-degree nose-down attitude, the nose pitched down from +7 to -2,5 degrees in 2-3 seconds. The stabilizer was then trimmed from -3,3 to +9 degrees which caused the pitch angle to increase again. The Ilyushin ran off the left side of the runway 3001 m past the runway threshold. The plane continued until colliding with a concrete obstruction. The aircraft caught fire and burned out almost completely.The investigation also revealed that the captain was the general director of the airline.

After contacting Melilla tower at 11:48 the crew were told to start the descent on their own discretion and to expect a runway 33 approach. A company flight was second on approach and requested runway 15 for landing. The ATC asked the crew of PH-FZE ""would you admit to use one five or do you prefer to keep on runway three three?"" The question was repeated and it took some time for the crew of PH-FZE to answer: ""We can accept runway one five"" at 11:56. They were then cleared to runway 15 with wind 250° and 11 kt. Four minutes later the aircraft was cleared to land with wind 240° at 12 kt varying between 210° and 300°. Due to the runway change, the pilot in command had decided to land with flaps 35° and a reference speed of 95 KIAS. The aircraft made some S-turns to lose altitude because it was a little high in the approach path. The airplane overflew the displaced threshold of runway 15 at approximately 15 ft. During the landing, the pilot in command realised that he could not engage the propeller ground idle/reverse, he said ""I have no reverse"" and applied brakes in an attempt to stop the aircraft. Later on, the co-pilot also applied brakes. During the landing roll the aircraft did not decelerate as expected. The wheel number 3 became locked and was deflated by a flat spot. The aircraft started to veer to the left of the runway until wheel number 1 left the runway at around 150 m before the end of the 1347 m long runway.

The intention was then to fly from Rumbek Aerodrome to Lokichoggio in Kenya. During the VFR flight to Rumbek Aerodrome, the crew experienced a north-easterly wind with extremely turbulent conditions.Prior to landing at Rumbek Aerodrome, the crew calculated the approach and landing indicated air speeds (IAS) to be 85 kts and 75 kts respectively. The crew then joined the circuit accordingly for landing on runway 01. Approximately 4 nm away from landing, the co-pilot warned the pilot-in-command of a whirlwind in the area, close to the threshold of runway 01.The whirlwind appeared to have dissipated and the pilot-in-command continued with the landing with full flaps. At approximately 100 ft above ground level and 100 m before the threshold of runway 01, the IAS suddenly decreased to 70 kts. The pilot-in-command said that he immediately selected full power in order to arrest the rate of descent as wind shear in Southern Sudan and especially at Rumbek at this time of the year was a common factor. The aircraft nevertheless continued to descend and the left-hand propeller and left-hand main landing gear collided with a tree approximately 20 m before the threshold of runway 01. The tree was approximately 6 ft high and on an embankment. The aircraft then struck a drainage ditch before the threshold, causing the left-hand main landing gear to collapse. The airplane bounced and landed on the runway. The co-pilot immediately retracted the flaps and the aircraft continued down the runway on the right-hand main landing gear, but as its speed decayed, the left-hand propeller impacted with the runway surface. The aircraft veered to the left off the runway and entered a drainage ditch parallel to the runway. Both left and right-hand main landing gear were torn out of their attachment points and the aircraft eventually came to rest on its lower fuselage section.

The airline transport pilot, who was the sole occupant of the airplane, received minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight, and a flight plan was not filed. The flight departed Houston-William P. Hobby Airport, TX (HOU) at approximately 09:15. The pilot reported that while on the base leg, the annunciator light for the ""low pitch stop"" propeller system on the right side illuminated. The pilot pulled the circuit breaker and left it out, as per the pilot operating handbook (POH). During the landing-roll, the pilot encountered a severe yaw to the right. The pilot added power to the right engine and realigned the airplane down the centerline. He then applied brakes and reverse thrust. The pilot stated that "" it felt like I had no braking action and then felt the right side grab and brake, but not the left."" The combination of right side braking and the right low pitch system malfunction caused considerable adverse yaw, jerking the plane to the right. The pilot applied power again and straightened the nose of the airplane. He then made the decision to go around, but at this point did not have adequate airspeed or runway length to safely accomplish a go around. He applied the brakes again, and the airplane immediately yawed to the right again, at which time the pilot was unable to compensate before the airplane caught the edge of the runway. The airplane went into the grass, where the pilot attempted to control the direction of the airplane and bring it to a complete stop.

There were eight passengers on board and the intention was for a return flight to take place later on the same day. The weather conditions recorded at 1320 hrs (5 minutes before the accident) were as follows: surface wind 240°/6 kt, varying in direction between 170° and 290°, visibility 16 kilometres, few cloud at 2,500 feet, temperature 18°C and QNH 1022 mb. The aircraft arrived in the Leeds area from the south and was vectored towards the left-hand downwind position for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to runway 14. At this time the first officer was the pilot flying. As the aircraft neared the airfield, the commander established visual contact and requested a visual approach. The first officer was still the handling pilot but was being given some guidance by the commander during the descent and subsequent turn onto final approach. At around five miles on the final approach the commander took over as handling pilot and the aircraft was passed a landing clearance by Air Traffic Control (ATC). At this stage the aircraft was established on the visual glidepath, 3.5° for this runway, in a clean configuration at an airspeed of 220 kt. The aircraft continued descending on a 3.5° glidepath. At approximately 2 nm from the runway threshold an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) Mode 4 ""TOO LOW TERRAIN"" alert was received. With the aircraft at 1.5 nm the speedbrake was extended and shortly after this, at a speed of 210 kt, 15° of flap was selected. Between 1.5 and 1.0 nm, ATC advised the crew that the landing gear was not down, to which the commander replied ""WE KNOW"". The landing gear was then selected down and, shortly afterwards, at a speed of 195 kt, full flap was selected. A second ""TOO LOW TERRAIN"" alert sounded twice but the repeat was interrupted by the auto callout ""MINIMUMS"" which occurred at 200 feet agl. Immediately afterwards there was one further ""TOO LOW TERRAIN"" aural alert and then a ""SINK RATE SINK RATE"" alert. The aircraft began the landing flare in the region of the touchdown zone at a speed of 155 kt, floated for a considerable distance along the runway and then touched down beyond the runway mid-point at a speed of 121 kt. After touchdown the commander applied full reverse thrust but did not use the wheelbrakes immediately. Wheel braking commenced at around 1,900 feet (585 metres) from the end of the paved surface and continued until the aircraft started to run onto the grass. The aircraft left the paved area at a speed estimated to be 20 kt to 30 kt and came to rest in a nose-down attitude.",13:25,2 Pratt & Whitney Canada PW535A,,Repaired,,,,,,,,,

The flight with number OHY 2263 originated from Dalaman (Turkey). On board were 7 crew members and 146 passengers. During the non-precision approach, the aircraft was not properly lined up and too high for landing. A go-around was initiated at 08:28. The published missed approach procedure (i.e. climb 2,000 feet on track 053, contact ATC) was not followed. Instead, a left hand visual circuit was made at an altitude of 1,000 feet. ATC did not challenge this deviation from the standard procedure. The aircraft made an uneventful landing on runway 05 at 08:33.At Groningen Airport Eelde 76 passengers disembarked. The 70 passengers with destination Maastricht-Aachen Airport remained on board. An additional 72 passengers with destination Dalaman boarded the aircraft making a total of 142 passengers on board.The load and trim sheet as prepared by the crew assumed 70 passengers in compartment #1 and 70 passengers in compartment #2. Since seat allocation was not used for the passengers (free seating policy), the actual distribution differed. The purser stated that the aft part of the cabin had not been occupied by passengers. According to the load and trim sheet the centre of gravity for takeoff (TO-CG) was at 11.1% mean aerodynamic cord (MAC) and the takeoff mass was 127,529 lb (57846 kg). During flight preparation, the ""Onur Air takeoff performance chart with optimum flap setting for Groningen Airport Eelde runway 23"" was used. This flaps setting was 24 degrees.At 09:09 the start-up clearance for runway 05 as runway in use was received. On request of the flight crew runway 23 was approved for departure by ATC.Engine start and taxi-out were uneventful. During taxi the flight was cleared for a domestic flight from Groningen Airport Eelde to Maastricht Aachen Airport as OHY 2264. The final destination was Dalaman (Turkey). At 09:18 the aircraft received takeoff clearance for runway 23. The captain stated that after the aircraft was lined up on runway 23 the takeoff was initiated. After the throttles were advanced, the stabilizer warning sounded. The throttles were retarded and the aircraft stopped. The captain stated that the aircraft had moved five to six meters before it stopped. Eyewitnesses reported that 50 to 150 meters were used before the takeoff run was resumed. On the runway checks were performed. The stabilizer position was changed from 6.8 to 7.2 degrees aircraft nose up (ANU). Thereafter the crew initiated a static engine spin-up. Again the stabilizer warning sounded. The crew released the brakes and started the takeoff roll. During the entire takeoff roll the warning sounded continuously.When attempting to rotate the captain experienced a heavy elevator control force. The captain stated that he needed much more than normal back pressure on his control column to lift the nose. He felt ""it was impossible to make the takeoff"", and as the nose did not rise he decided to reject the takeoff. Rejection was initiated at 128 knots. Brakes and reversed engine thrust had been applied. The aircraft overran the runway end with a speed of approximately 75 knots. During the deceleration in the soft soil, it hit the approach lighting system, including the concrete structures embedded in the ground. It came to a stop approximately 100 meters beyond the runway end. There was no fire. All occupants evacuated the aircraft safely. Some of them returned to the aircraft and re-entered it, to pick up their belongings. In addition, the pilots remained on board and only left the aircraft when instructed to do so by the fire brigade.",09:22,2 Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219,,Repaired,,2264,,,,,,,

Immediately after installation of these actuators the deflection speed for right rudder input decreased from 38,2 degrees per second to 18,3 degrees per second on the day of the accident. Noticeable more pressure was necessary for full rudder deflection. Although the captain noticed this prior to departure, he decided to continue anyway. During takeoff from Nyagan's runway 16/34 the aircraft began to deviate to the left of the centerline. This movement could insufficiently be countered by applying rudder. So, while accellerating through 150 km/h, the captain decided to use nosewheel steering. One of the tyres on the nosegear then failed. At a speed of 250 km/h takeoff was abandoned. Neither spoilers nor emergency brakes were used, so the Tupolev could not be brought to a halt on the 2530 m long runway and overran the runway by 577 metres.

With a normal deceleration the aircraft needed about 6700 feet (1737 m) to come to a stop.Auto speed brakes worked normally and reversers were deployed immediately. Everything being normal during the first part of the landing roll and normal deceleration being noted, the captain cut off the autobrakes at an estimated speed of 100 kts via brake pedals in order to stop the aircraft further by manual braking. At an estimated 3000 feet from the runway end, the pilot noted that there was ""no feeling of deceleration"". At 80 kts no slow down of the aircraft was noted despite ""full braking"".

The first officer was the pilot flying on that leg. The captain of the flight was a company check airman who was conducting a multi-leg line check for the first officer. The flight was routine until the approach to Memphis.At 12:06 the captain contacted Memphis Approach. He was told to expect an approach to runway 36L. After listening out the ATIS, the captain advised the first officer that the winds were out of ""three twenty at sixteen gusts to twenty two. Ten miles [visibility]. It's still saying wind shear."" At 12:15 Memphis Approach informed the flight that they should expect to land on runway 36R instead of 36L, as previously instructed. Six minutes later the captain radioed that they had the airport in sight. The controller cleared them for a visual approach and instructed the captain to contact Memphis Tower. The tower controller stated: ""FedEx six forty seven heavy, Memphis tower, number two following a heavy Airbus two mile final caution wake turbulence runway three six right. Gain and loss of ten [knots] short final runway three six right, cleared to land."" The airplane was configured for landing and the crew discussed adding 4 knots to the Vref speed.A single tailwind shear alert sounded about 12:23:52. Moments later the airplane descended through 1000 feet. The captain confirmed the approach was stable and the approach to land was continued.During the 20 seconds before touchdown, the airplane's descent rate was 12.5 feet per second (fps) with +/- 2.5-fps oscillations. At 12:25:52, the airplane's left main landing gear touched down at a rate of about 12.5 fps; about 0.25 second later, the right main landing gear touched down at a rate of about 14.5 fps. The MD-10 landing gear is designed to be capable of absorbing energy that is equivalent to a maximum airplane descent rate of 12 fps.The excessive vertical and lateral forces on the right main landing gear during the landing exceeded those design limits and resulted in the fracture of the outer cylinder and the collapse of the right main landing gear. The airplane began to bank and turn to the right. The crew were unable to steer the airplane back to the left and it skidded off the right side of the runway and came to a stop in the grass. Shortly after coming to a stop there was an explosion and a fire developed on the right side to the airplane. All seven occupants were able to successfully evacuate the airplane using the cockpit windows.",12:26,3 General Electric CF6-6D,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),104 m (341 feet) amsl,647,65375,,,,26163,,

The forward thrust from the left engine overpowered the brakes, resulting in the airplane exiting the departure end of the runway at a speed over 100 kts.

About 12,5 km out, the aircraft's rate of descent increased, causing it to descend below the glideslope. The rate of descent was arrested at a height of 170 m, 8 km from the threshold of runway 08L and they continued in level flight. At the Outer Marker (3,5 km from the runway) they should have started their initial approach, but the crew continued level flight thus flying above the glideslope now. With 2,5 km to go the airplane descended slightly at 1-1,5 m/sec. At the Inner Marker the descent rate increased to 2-2,6 m/sec. The crew then probably saw the runway lights below them. The engines were brought back to idle and reverse thrust was applied at a height of 60 m. When it appeared that they would not be able to land given the remaining runway length, reverse thrust was deselected and engine power was increased. At that point the airplane touched down 260 m past the end of the runway. It continued until the right wing struck a concrete building.

An intermediate stop was made at Halifax (YHZ), where the aircraft landed at 02:12 local time. At YHZ the aircraft was loaded with 53,000 kilograms of lobster and fish. After fueling, the total fuel load was 89 400 kg. The planned takeoff weight was 353 000 kg. The Boeing Laptop Tool (BLT) was then used to calculate the takeoff speeds. Since the software was last used before the takeoff from Bradley, it still contained those figures. The airport information and weather was changed to Halifax, but somehow the takeoff weight was not changed and remained showing 240.000 kg. Takeoff performance data were generated, resulting in incorrect V speeds and thrust setting being transcribed to the takeoff data card. It is most likely that the crew did not adhere to the operator's procedures for an independent check of the takeoff data card, so the erroneous figures went unnoticed.It was dark, but the weather was fine as the airplane was cleared to taxi to runway 24 (8800 ft / 2682 m long) for departure. After push back, the aircraft began to taxi, the flaps were extended to 20°, and the horizontal stabilizer was set to 6.1 trim units, where it remained for the duration of the flight. The flight control checks were completed during the taxi. The aircraft entered runway 24 at Taxiway Delta and backtracked to the threshold. The aircraft then made a 180° turn to the right and, upon lining up with the runway, the thrust levers were advanced and a rolling takeoff was commenced at 06:53:22.At the start of the takeoff roll, the thrust levers were smoothly advanced from ground idle thrust (approximately 1.0 EPR) to takeoff power with all final EPR settings indicating between 1.3 and 1.33. The aircraft accelerated through 80 KCAS (06:53:46) approximately 1800 feet (550 m) from the threshold.At 130 KCAS, the control column was moved aft to 8.4° to initiate rotation as the aircraft passed the 5500-foot (1680 m) mark of runway 24 (3300 feet / 1010 m of runway remaining). The aircraft began to rotate. The pitch attitude stabilized briefly at approximately 9° nose-up, with airspeed at 144 KCAS. Because the 747 still had not lifted off the runway, the control column was moved further aft to 10°, and the aircraft responded with a further pitch up to approximately 11°; initial contact of the lower aft fuselage with the runway occurred at this time. The aircraft was approximately at the 8000-foot (2450 m) mark and slightly left of the centreline. The control column was then relaxed slightly, to 9° aft. The pitch attitude stabilized in the 11° range for the next four seconds, and the lower aft fuselage contact with the runway ended briefly. With approximately 600 feet (185 m) of runway remaining, the thrust levers were advanced to 92 per cent and the EPRs increased to 1.60. With 420 feet (130 m) remaining, the lower aft fuselage contacted the runway a second time. As the aircraft passed the end of the runway, the control column was 13.5° aft, pitch attitude was 11.9° nose-up, and airspeed was 152 KCAS. The highest recorded nose-up pitch of 14.5° (06:54:24) was recorded after the aircraft passed the end of the runway at a speed of 155 KCAS. The aircraft became airborne approximately 670 feet (205 m) beyond the paved surface and flew a distance of 325 feet (100 m). The lower aft fuselage then struck an earthen berm supporting an instrument landing system (ILS) localizer antenna. The aircraft's tail separated on impact, and the rest of the aircraft continued in the air for another 1200 feet (370 m) before it struck terrain and burst into flames.",03:56,4 Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7Q,,,,1602,80619,,,,16368,,

From the performance and speed reference cards the crew ascertained the decision speeds for a reduced engine thrust 10° flap takeoff as follows; V1 - 162 KIAS, Vr - 174 KIAS and V2 - 180 KIAS. The crew lined-up the aircraft for a full length takeoff and was cleared for takeoff at 16:31:42.

The auto throttle and autopilot were disengaged during the approach, about 800 feet agl. However, the auto throttle reengaged just prior to touchdown, about 35 feet agl. The airplane touched down within the first 2,000 feet of the runway, and slightly right of runway centerline. The crew were not aware that the auto throttle had reengaged. The target airspeed set for the auto throttlesystem was 138 knots. After touchdown, as the airplane decelerated below 138 knots, the auto throttle system gradually increased the power levers in an attempt to maintain the target airspeed. Without the power levers in the idle position, the ground spoilers and thrust reversers would not deploy. While the flightcrew was pulling up on the thrust reverser levers, they may not have initially provided enough aft force on the power levers (15 to 32 lb) to override and disconnect the auto throttle system. The flight data recorder indicated that the autothrottle system disengaged 16 seconds after the weight-on-wheels switches were activated in ground mode. As the airplane neared the end of the runway, the pilot engaged the emergency brake, and the airplane departed the right side of the runway. The airplane then traveled over a grassy area, struck trees, and came to rest upright.",16:23,2 Rolls-Royce Tay 611-8,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,946,7452,,,,,,

The first officer then confirmed that he had nose wheel steering.The aircraft almost immediately began moving towards the left hand side of the runway. The first officer tried to use the brakes and the directional rudder to return the aircraft to the centre of the runway. The aircraft had a speed of between 50 and 60 knots at that point. The crew rejected the takeoff but could not prevent the aircraft ending up alongside the runway, on the left hand side.The grass area alongside the runway is lower than the runway and the ground was soft. The left landing gear sank in the soft ground first and, as a result, the aircraft decelerated heavily and the left landing gear broke off almost immediately. The tip of the left wing struck the ground. This caused a ground loop effect and turned the aircraft further left. As a consequence the right landing gear and the nose gear also broke off.

Air traffic control cleared the flightcrew for the ILS approach to runway 24, which was 4,897 feet long. The flightcrew then reported that they had the runway in sight, cancelled their IFR clearance, and executed a VFR approach in VFR conditions to the airport. The reported winds favoured a landing toward the east, onto the opposite runway (runway 6). During the approach, after a query from the first officer, the captain indicated to the first officer that he was going to ""...land to the east,"" consistent with the reported winds. However, the final approach and subsequent landing were made to runway 24, which produced a six-knot tailwind. During the approach sequence the captain maintained an airspeed that was approximately 30 knots higher than the correct airspeed for the aircraft's weight, resulting in the aircraft touching down about 1,500 feet further down the runway than normal, and much faster than normal. The captain then delayed the initiation of a go-around until the first officer asked if they were going around. Although the aircraft lifted off the runway surface prior to departing the paved overrun during the delayed go-around it impacted a localizer antenna platform, whose highest non-frangible structure was located approximately 304 feet past the end of the runway, and approximately two feet lower than the terrain at the departure end of the runway.

The previous two flights had been carried out with a deactivated right engine thrust reverser.On July 9, Sibir flight 778 departed Domodeovo (DME) at night for a flight to Irkutsk (IKT). Weather at Irkutsk was poor. It was raining, overcast clouds at 600 feet and a thunderstorm in the area. At 07:38 the co-pilot reported the completion of the final leg at 850 m, whereupon he received instructions to contact Irkutsk tower. The Irkutsk tower controller cleared the crew for an approach to runway 30. Descent to the final approach leg was carried out using the airplane captain's navigational display in VOR mode, and that of the co-pilot in ILS mode, to control the airplane's position relative to the course using indications from the localizer beacon. At 07:40:18 the co-pilot reported: ""Sibir 7-7-8 descending, landing gear down, ready for landing"", whereupon he received the controller's clearance to land. At 07:43:13, 1500 meters short of the runway threshold and at a height of 105 m, the crew disengaged auto-pilot no. 1, and switched off the auto-throttle 2 seconds afterwards.After breaking through the clouds, the captain obtained visual contact with the runway. He made a small elevator deflection to pitch down, which led momentarily to an increase in vertical speed and activation (at 07:43:30, at 30 m), of the ""SINK RATE"" ground proximity warning. At 07:43:40 the captain landed the airplane at a speed of 244 kph (132 knots) at a distance of about 200-300 meters from the runway threshold. Immediately after touchdown, with the spoiler handle armed, all spoiler sections were automatically released. 1.5 seconds after touchdown the reverse thrust lever of the right engine was moved to idle by the captain, and 3 seconds after that, after the reverser doors were in their working position, switched to maximum reverse thrust. Engine reverse thrust then started to increase. In violation of SOPs, the co-pilot did not call out the completion of reverser door movement to the working position (Rev Green). The crew did not activate the reverse thrust lever for the left engine. Afterwards the captain began to shift the reverse thrust lever of the right engine to reduce reverse thrust. Simultaneously with moving the reverse thrust lever of the right engine, the FDR records a change in position of the thrust control lever of the left engine, which in 3 steps, over 16 seconds, increased from 36.6° (idle) to 59° (~60% of the full rated takeoff thrust). The direction and periods of movement of the reverse thrust lever of engine no. 2 to reduce the reverse thrust and the thrust control lever of engine no. 1 to increase forward thrust coincided.Because of the movement of the thrust control lever to a position greater than 10°, the spoilers retracted automatically. Retraction of the spoilers led to the deactivation of the automatic braking mode. At this time the speed was about 180 kph (98 knots) and, on account of the large asymmetry of engine thrust, the airplane started to turn to the right, which the airplane captain counteracted by depressing the left pedal and forcibly applying the brakes. The speed stabilized at 98 knots. At 07:44:21 the crew (most probably the co-pilot) tried once again to deploy the thrust reverser on the right engine, for which he moved the reverse thrust lever of the engine over to maximum reverse thrust but, per design, the location of the thrust control lever for the left engine in a mode higher than 55° prevented the operation, and the thrust reverser doors failed to unlock. The right engine remained at idle forward thrust. After this attempt to deploy the thrust reverser, the airplane started to swerve to the left. The crew attempted to correct this movement and the airplane started to drift to the right. The right main bogie exited the runway at a speed of 98 knots, and the nose landing gear and the left main bogie moved along the reinforced concrete portion of the runway. The nose landing gear and the left main bogie exited on to the ground at the end of the reinforced concrete runway at 07:44:36. The airplane traveled over clay soil with a grassy cover. At a distance of 210 m from the threshold of runway 12, the left engine destroyed part of the antenna and the wooden fence of the localizer beacon system. At a distance of 250 m from the threshold of runway 12, the airplane crossed an asphalt bypass road. The airplane stopped at 07:44:40 after colliding with a reinforced concrete airport perimeter fence and with brick structures (garages) behind it. The airplane broke apart during the collision and burst into flames.",07:44,2 Pratt & Whitney PW4152,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),494 m (1621 feet) amsl,778,59865,,,,12550,,

He therefore decided to increase his approach speed by 10 knots. In addition to the increased airspeed, the pilot flew a flatter than normal approach descent angle. Due to the increased airspeed and the flatter approach, the airplane floated longer than normal after the initiation of the landing flare. Instead of executing a go-around after it became obvious that the airplane would not settle to the runway near the normal touchdown point, the pilot elected to continue the landing sequence. Once the airplane touched down, the pilot was unable to get it stopped in the remaining runway, and it departed the end of the runway and experienced a nose gear collapse after encountering rough/uneven, swampy terrain. The expected landing distance for the airplane was calculated based upon the Vref plus ten airspeed of 108 knots, a landing gross weight of 11,000 pounds, and the reported ambient weather conditions.

The airplane departed Stavanger at 07:17 and positioned for an approach to runway 33 at Stord around 07:30. Before OY-CRG started its approach, the airport performed a routine runway inspection. The runway report did not contain information with regard to whether the runway was dry, damp or wet. Because the crew were not informed otherwise, they assumed that the runway was dry. However, investigations by the AIBN have revealed that the runway was in fact damp. A corresponding aircraft had performed a normal landing towards the south (runway 15) 15 minutes earlier. The crew of OY-CRG were given a wind reading of 120° at 6 knots. They had visual contact with the airport at an early stage and decided to carry out a visual approach northwards (runway 33). Upon landing the pilots noted that the aircraft's lift spoilers did not deploy. The indicator lights that normally light up after 3 seconds did not do so. The pilots immediately called ""No spoilers"". Thereafter the pilots experienced that the maximum application of the brakes did not lead to the expected deceleration. The alternative braking system was brought into use and then finally the emergency brakes, without this making any difference. The emergency brakes do not have anti-skid protection and the wheels locked, so that in combination with the damp runway reverted rubber hydroplaning occurred. Consequently the friction against the runway was significantly reduced.The commander had a certain directional control of the aircraft and wanted to avoid leaving the runway at places where he knew that the terrain was particularly unfavourable. The aircraft left the runway end to the north at a relatively low speed of 15-20 knots. It continued down a steep slope and the aircraft sustained significant damage as it crashed into lighting poles, trees and large rocks. When the aircraft came to rest, it was not possible to stop the left inner engine (no. 2) due to the damage. It continued to operate at a high rpm for several minutes. The forward left emergency exit could not be opened due to damage to the fuselage that had jammed the door. The forward right emergency exit was blocked by the terrain outside. The commander made several attempts to open and release the cockpit door without success. The cabin roof had sustained a large rift which resulted in fuel from the wings entering the cabin. A fire on the aircrafts right side spread into the cabin and over to the aircrafts left side. Three passengers and the forward cabin crew member were killed. The remaining nine passengers and the rear cabin crew member managed to evacuate the aircraft from the aircrafts rear left emergency exit by jumping to the ground and passing the engine that was still running. Six people sustained serious burns. According to the manufacturers approved documentation, it is to be expected that the landing distance would increase by 40% if all lift spoilers were inoperative. The AIBN has calculated that under the prevailing conditions OY-CRG should have stopped around 100 metres before the end of the runway. The aircrafts undercarriage has been thoroughly examined by the AIBN. A number of fragments of ""boiled"" rubber were found on the runway. Further, a tyre showed clear indications of so-called ""rubber reversal"" which occurs when a cushion of steam forms and the rubber is ""boiled"" under the tyres.",07:32,4 Lycoming ALF502R-5,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),49 m (161 feet) amsl,RC670,39828,,,,21726,,

The weather at this time was as follows: wind 120° at two knots; visibility 15 miles, and a few clouds at 12 000 feet and 21 000 feet.About 13 nautical miles (nm) west of the airport, the aircraft was descending through 7000 feet at a ground speed of 350 knots. The spoilers were twice deployed during the descent. At about 6 nm from the runway, the flaps were extended to 8° and then 20°. After it was confirmed that the landing gear was down and locked, the flap selector switch was moved to the DN (down) position to extend the flaps to 40°; the flaps and the position indicator remained at 20°. The first officer informed the captain of the discrepancy by pointing to the indicator and stated that the hydraulic pressure was normal. At that time, the aircraft was abeam the final approach fix, 1000 feet above the glidepath at 150 knots, 26 knots above Vref.It was established that the runway was sufficiently long for a partial flap landing and the approach was continued. The crew members' intention was to exit at the end of the runway to be near their ground destination, and their plan was to deploy the spoilers and thrust reversers and to delay the use of the brakes after touchdown. At 500 feet above touchdown, the aircraft was about 1 nm from the threshold at approximately 155 knots and slightly above the glidepath. At about 200 feet above touchdown, the enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS) produced oral alerts ""TOO LOW FLAPS"" indicating that the flaps were not in the landing configuration. The captain immediately requested flaps 40, and the co-pilot informed him that the flap indicator was at 20°.Runway 06R is 9600 feet long by 200 feet wide, and there is an asphalt pad, 200 feet by 200 feet, at each end of the runway. The aircraft touched down about 1000 feet past the threshold at approximately 130 knots. According to the aircraft flight manual (AFM), the landing distance for the aircraft configuration at the time of landing was 3300 feet with a flap setting of 20°. At about 3500 feet from the threshold, the spoiler switch was set to the extend position (EXT), but the spoilers did not deploy, which went unnoticed by the crew. Starting at about 4800 feet, the captain attempted three times, without success, to move the thrust reverser levers beyond the idle/deploy stop. At about 8300 feet, the captain announced that there were no brakes. At the end of the runway, the captain called for the brace position. The aircraft was travelling at approximately 53 knots as it went off the end of the runway.As the aircraft rolled through the soft ground, the left wing struck three light posts from the first row of approach lights. Shortly after, the nosewheel ran over a manhole after which the left wing struck three light posts from the second row of approach lights. The aircraft came to rest 600 feet past the end of the paved area off the end of the runway. Immediately after the aircraft came to a stop, the captain ordered the evacuation. There was significant damage to the aircraft in the area of the nosewheel, the left wing, and the left side of the fuselage.",05:07,,,Repaired,,,,,,,,,

The captain, first officer and 9 passengers on board were not injured. The flight originated at 15:33.The captain reported he had planned a visual straight-in approach to runway 12. He said the approach and landing was to be performed based on a landing weight of 13,847 pounds with wing flaps at 35 degrees, an approach speed of 121 knots, and a reference of final approach to landing speed (Vref) of 111 knots. The captain said that on short final, the speed was 125 knots and that they were ""one dot high"" on the approach. He said that on rounding out, he reduced power and placed both hands on the control yoke to have better control of the airplane as there had been some light turbulence. He said this resulted in some excessive floating, though the airplane did touch down softly on the right main tire approximately 2,500 feet down from the runway threshold.

TAM Flight 3054 was a regular passenger flight from Porto Alegre to São Paulo-Congonhas. The aircraft departed Porto Alegre at 17:19 with 181 passengers and 6 crew members on board.The aircraft was operating with the number 2 engine reverser de-activated, in accordance with the Minimum Equipment List (MEL).The weather prevailing along the route and at the destination was adverse, and the crew had to make a few deviations. Up to the moment of the landing, the flight occurred within the expected routine.According to information provided to the Tower controller by crews that had landed earlier, the active runway at Congonhas (35L) was wet and slippery. Runway 35L is a 6365 x 147 feet (1940 x 45 meters) asphalt runway with a Landing Distance Available of 1880 m.In the beginning of 2007, the runways at Congonhas were subjected to a restoration to correct surface irregularities and correct problems of gradient, so as to prevent water accumulation. With the new pavement, the coefficient of friction of the runway surface was improved. However, since more time was be needed until the tarmac could be ready to receive the grooving, the airport administration decided to put the main runway in operation even without the grooves on 29 June 2007.The flight touched down at 18:54 local time at a speed of 142 knots. Airbus had introduced a simplified procedure for landing with a deactivated thrust reverser in which crews had to select reversers for both engines after landing. Computer logic would which reverser was inoperative and thus block the increase in power. This simplified procedure however added an additional 55 meters in the calculations of the runway length required for landing if the runway was contaminated.However, the flight crew failed to use this procedure and left the thrust lever of engine no.2 positioned at ""CL"".This caused the autothrust to try to maintain the speed previously selected. Another consequence was the nondeflection of the ground spoilers, since, in accordance with their logic of operation, it is necessary that both thrust levers be at the ""IDLE"" position, or one of them be at ""IDLE"" and the other at ""REV"" (reverse), for the ground spoilers to be deflected.The non-deflection of the ground spoilers significantly degraded the aircraft braking capability, increasing the distance necessary for a full stop of the airplane by about 50%.Additionally the autobrake function, although armed, was not activated, because the opening of the ground spoilers is a prerequisite for such activation.When the nose gear touched the runway, about 2.5 seconds after the left main gear, the number 1 engine thrust lever was moved to the ""REV"" position. With this action, the autothrust function of the aircraft was disconnected and the thrust lock function was activated, with the purpose of preventing the acceleration to reach the climb power level.As a result, this function froze the number 2 engine power in the value it was at that moment (EPR2 = 1.18). The thrust lock function is disabled by the movement of the thrust lever, but since this movement did not occur, the number 2 engine remained with that power until the collision.About six seconds after the main gear touched the runway, there was the first activation of the brakes by means of the pedals, which reached the maximum deflection five seconds later.The FDR also recorded the use of the rudder and the differential braking by the pedals as the aircraft veered to the left.Since the runway is at a higher elevation than the surrounding street and residential area, the A320 crossed over the Washington Luís Avenue, and collided with a concrete TAM Express building and a fuel service station at a ground speed of 96 knots. All the persons onboard suffered fatal injuries. The accident also caused 12 fatalities on the ground among the people that were in the TAM Express building.The accident caused severe damage to the convenience shop area of the service station and to some vehicles that were parked there. The TAM Express building sustained structural damages that determined its demolition.",18:54,2 IAE V2527-A5,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),802 m (2631 feet) amsl,JJ3054,20000,Fatalities: 12,,,9300,,

The commercial pilot and three passengers were not injured. The personal flight departed from Lincoln Regional Airport, California, about 08:54, with a planned destination of Carlsbad. At the time of the accident, the pilot had canceled his instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, and was executing a visual flight rules (VFR) approach to runway 24 in visual meteorological conditions. As the airplane approached the destination airport, the pilot selected vertical speed mode on the autopilot. While descending, the copilot's Primary Flight Display (PFD) began to flicker. About 5 minutes later, as the airplane transitioned through 28,000 feet mean sea level, the left PFD flashed a ""PFT"" alert indicating that the autopilot had disconnected. The pilot said he immediately felt heavy control forces on the control yoke that he had to exert to fly the airplane. Shortly thereafter, the pilot discovered that the electric pitch trim was not operational. While hand-flying the airplane the pilot entered instrument meteorological conditions as the airplane descended through a 2,400-foot-thick cloud layer. Thereafter, the pilot continued a visual approach to the 4,897-foot-long runway. The pilot noted that he was overwhelmed with the electrical failures and fatigued from maneuvering the airplane by hand for such a long duration (which he approximated was around 45 minutes). The airplane crossed the runway threshold about 15 knots faster than the correct landing speed and the airplane touched down past the midpoint of the runway. The pilot realized that despite his braking attempts the airplane was going to continue off the runway surface over a small downsloping cliff at the end. He determined that he would not be able to abort the landing due to the airplane's diminished ground speed and elected to perform a 180-degree turn. The airplane ground looped, coming to rest in a dirt area south of the runway; the main landing gear collapsed and the flaps folded under the wings. According to the pilot, he never attempted to reset the autopilot system. The autopilot was designed for an automatic disengagement when there is a system failure, invalid sensor data, or yaw damper failure. On the manufacturer's current Pilots' Abbreviated Checklist, Emergency Procedures section, it states that if the autopilot preflight test fail warning (red ""PFT"" warning on the PFD) illuminates, the pilot should reset the associated circuit breaker to clear the fault.

The pilot in command  acted as pilot flying while the co-pilot acted as pilot monitoring.The flight time from Jakarta to Jambi was estimated to be about one hour and the aircraft was dispatched with approximately 4 hours of fuel endurance. The number one electrical engine driven generator was unserviceable, as such the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) generator was used during the flight to maintain two generators operation.Prior to descent into Jambi, the PIC conducted the crew briefing and stated a plan for making a straight-in approach to runway 31 with flap 40°, reviewed the go-around procedures and stated that Palembang was the alternate airport. There was no abnormality recorded nor reported until the flight commenced the approach to Jambi.At 16:18 hours, the co-pilot contacted Thaha Tower controller and reported that the aircraft was descending and passing FL160 and had been cleared by Palembang Approach control to descend to 12,000 feet. The Thaha Tower controller issued a clearance to descend to 2500 feet and advised that runway 31 was in use. The cp-pilot asked about the weather conditions and was informed that the wind was calm, rain over the field and low cloud on final approach to runway 31.The pilot flew the aircraft direct to intercept the final approach to runway 31. While descending through 2500 feet, and about 8 miles from the VOR, the flap one degree and flap 5° were selected. Subsequently the landing gear was extended and flap 15° was selected.13 seconds after flap 15 selection, the pilots noticed that the hydraulic system A low pressure warning light illuminated, and also the hydraulic system A quantity indicator showed zero. The pilot commanded the co-pilot to check the threshold speed for the existing configuration of landing, weight and with flap 15°. The co-pilot called out that the threshold speed was 134 kts and the pilot decided to continue with the landing.The pilot continued the approach and advised the co-pilot that he aimed to fly the aircraft slightly below the normal glide path in order to get more distance available for the landing roll.The aircraft touched down at 16:30 and during the landing roll, the pilot had difficulty selecting the thrust reversers. The pilot then applied manual braking. The pilot reapplied the brakes and exclaimed to the co-pilot about the braking condition, then the co-pilot also applied the brakes to maximum in responding to the situation.The aircraft drifted to the right of the runway centre line about 200 meters prior to departing off the end of the runway, and stopped about 120 meters from the end of the runway 31 in a field about 6 meters below the runway level. Three farmers who were working in that area were hit by the aircraft. One was fatally injured and the other two were seriously injured.The pilots reported that, after the aircraft came to a stop, they executed the Emergency on Ground Procedure. The pilot could not put both start levers to the cut-off position, and also could not pull the engines and APU fire warning levers. The pilot also noticed that the speed brake lever did not extend. The radio communications and the interphone were also not working.The flight attendants noticed a significant impact before the aircraft stopped. They waited for any emergency command from the pilot before ordering the evacuation.However, the passengers started to evacuate the aircraft through the right over-wing exit window before commanded by the flight attendants. The flight attendants subsequently executed the evacuation procedure without command from the pilot.The left aft cabin door was blocked by the left main landing gear that had detached from the aircraft and the flight attendants were unable to open the door.

The certificated airline transport pilot and his one passenger were uninjured. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local maintenance flight. According to the pilot who was an employee of the United States Department of Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management, he and a mechanic needed to do a quick maintenance test flight to check the pressurization system before departing for California the following day. The pilot advised that he had followed the maintenance done to the airplane during the day while attending to other business associated with an upgrade to the avionics system.The pilot asked to have the two right main tires changed and monitored that maintenance activity as well. At approximately 17:00, the pilot had the airplane's main fuel tanks filled completely. He then did his normal checks and walk around, and taxied the airplane to the end of runway 33 for a quick around the pattern flight.He departed runway 33, and did a few checks on the pressurization and flow packs, verifying functionality. The pilot then set up for a landing on runway 33 and upon touchdown, decided to add power and go-around, as something did not feel right.The pilot then came around for a second landing and landed long touching down approximately 700 feet down the runway, set his normal amount of beta (reverse) and started to apply brakes. He then realized that there was the possibility that he was going to ""overshoot"" because of poor braking action on the wet runway.The pilot found that it was very easy to skid the left brake, and that the right brake braking action was poor, until further down the runway. He decided not to abort the landing and go-around, due to the airplanes low indicated airspeed, the configuration of the airplane, the runway remaining, the rising terrain, and houses.The pilot tried to turn to the left without side loading the landing gear and thought he had the airplane stopped, until the airplane rolled off the runway pavement and on to the grass which was wet and he had no braking at all.

The copilot was the handling pilot for the flight sector from Ewer to Timika, and the PIC was the support/monitoring pilot.The PIC reported that the aircraft commenced sliding before brakes release, and shortly after commencing the takeoff roll the aircraft veered to the right, so he took over control from the copilot. However, he was unable to prevent the aircraft from swinging to the left and it rolled through the centreline to the left side of the runway.The PIC aborted the take off and attempted to regain the runway centreline from the left using nose-wheel steering. That attempt was unsuccessful, and the aircraft veered further left and slid off the runway into wet soft ground on the edge of the marsden matting runway.

The scheduled, domestic passenger flight was enroute to Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH). There were 37 injuries among the passengers and crew, and no fatalities. The airplane was substantially damaged and experienced a post-crash fire. The weather observation in effect at the time of the accident was reported to be winds at 290 and 24 knots with gusts to 32 knots, visibility of 10 miles, a few clouds at 4000 feet and scattered clouds at 10,000 feet. The temperature was reported as -4 degrees Celsius.The flight pushed back at 18:01. Ice and snow were visible on the ramp, so the captain started both engines and turned the engine and wing anti-ice systems on. The flight was cleared to taxi to 3W and the captain began to taxi the airplane. Approaching 3W, the first officer contacted ground control and received a clearance to taxi to runway 34R via taxiway F.As the airplane approached runway 34R, the flight crew performed the before takeoff checklist and contacted the tower. The tower instructed flight 1404 to position and hold on the runway. The runway appeared to be clear of snow and ice, so the captain decided to de-select the engine and wing anti-ice systems but he left the engine igniters on. The captain positioned the airplane on the runway and the flight crew waited for two or three minutes. The runway lights and all of the airplanes lights were on and runway visibility was excellent.The tower contacted the flight crew, informed them that winds were 270 degrees at 27 knots and cleared them for takeoff. The controllers wind report surprised the flight crew because it was higher than the wind reported in ATIS Sierra. The captain recalled saying something to the first officer like, ""Roger, crosswind."" The first officer recalled the captain saying, ""Winds are 270 at 27. You ready?""The captain was the flying pilot and he began a reduced-power takeoff. He first pushed the thrust levers up to achieve 40 percent N1, then increased power to 70 percent N1. He noticed a difference in the thrust being generated by the two engines, but the two engines matched as he increased N1 to 90 percent. After verifying this, he pressed the TOGA button and called out, ""check power."" The first officer responded that thrust was set at 90.9% N1. The captain applied a left control wheel correction, applied forward pressure to the yoke, and used variable right rudder to keep the airplane aligned with the runway centerline. He recalled that it felt at first like a ""normal crosswind takeoff.""The captain recalled that as the airplane was getting up to speed it suddenly yawed to the left, as if hit by a ""massive gust of wind,"" or as if the tires had hit a patch of ice and lost traction. He recalled using full right rudder but seeing the airplane continue to veer left. The first officer recalled that as airspeed was increasing from 87 to 90 knots he looked up and saw the airplane drifting left of the runway centerline. He thought the captain was correcting back to the right, but the airplane suddenly yawed 30 to 45 degrees to the left. It appeared to the first officer as if there was ""zero directional control."" He recalled feeling the rudder pedals with his feet and he believed the captain was applying full right rudder.The captain recalled facing the edge lights on the left side of the runway. He believed the airplane was going to exit the left side of the runway and, as a last resort, he reached down with his left hand and grabbed the tiller for a second or two. He attempted to steer the airplane back onto the runway using the tiller, but this did not work so he put his left hand back on the yoke.The captain recalled using right control wheel to keep the wings level as the airplane departed the left side of the runway. He said that he did this because he thought the ground next to the runway sloped down and he feared that the aft end of the fuselage would slide down that incline and cause the airplane to ""tumble on its side."" After the airplane had completely exited the runway, the captain said ""reject"" and tried to deploy the thrust reversers. He recalled that he was unable to deploy the reversers because the ride was very rough.The airplane was subjected to two violent impacts before it came to a stop. It was totally dark inside the cockpit. Neither the captain nor the first officer recalled hearing any engine sounds. Both were stunned and in pain and they felt incapable of doing anything for one or two minutes. They did not order an evacuation or perform the evacuation checklist.After recovering from the initial shock of the crash, the first officer opened a cockpit window to his right and threw out an escape rope, but he saw fire along the right side of the airplane and decided not to exit that way. He got out of his seat so he could exit through the cabin instead. As the first officer stood up, a deadheading crewmember knocked on the cockpit door and the first officer opened it. About this time, the captain was trying to get out of his seat as well, but a dislodged flight crew bag was blocking his path. The first officer moved the bag and he and the deadheading crewmember helped the captain out of the cockpit. The deadheading crewmember told the first officer that all of the passengers had been evacuated and then the captain, first officer and deadheading crewmember exited the airplane via the L1 slide.",18:18,2 CFMI CFM56-3C1,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),1655 m (5430 feet) amsl,1404,40541,,,,21511,,

Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for a cargo flight from Tulsa International Airport (TUL), Oklahoma.The co-pilot was performing a nighttime approach and landing to runway 25. No runway condition reports were received by the flight crew while airborne, and a NOTAM was in effect, stating, ""thin loose snow over patchy thin ice."" After landing, the co-pilot called out that the airplane was sliding and the wheel brakes were ineffective. The captain took the controls, activated the air brakes, and instructed the co-pilot to deploy the drag chute. The crew could not stop the airplane in the remaining runway distance and the airplane overran the runway by approximately 100 feet. After departing the runway end, the landing gear contacted a snow berm that was the result of earlier plowing. The captain turned the airplane around and taxied to the ramp. Subsequent inspection of the airplane revealed a fractured nose gear strut and buckling of the fuselage. The spring-loaded drag chute extractor cap activated, but the parachute remained in its tail cone container. Both flight crewmembers reported that the runway was icy at the time of the accident and braking action was ""nil."" The airport manager reported that when the airplane landed, no airport staff were on duty and had not been for several hours. He also reported that when the airport staff left for the evening, the runway conditions were adequate.

The seven crew members escaped unhurt.The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from Jeddah. During the flight, the captain discussed the use of manual spoilers during landing with the first officer. He further stated that; as he ""had only around 400 hours in the aircraft"" as a captain, he wanted to ""see the effect' of landing with manual spoilers. He further explained that the flight provided an opportunity to ""do it manually"" (use manual spoilers) as it was a repositioning flight and, the weather and dry runway conditions were ideal. As such, he discussed the procedure with the first officer and elected to land with the auto ground spoiler system unarmed.The flight was uneventful. During the approach to Riyadh the Landing Checklist was completed, which included the arming of the auto ground spoiler system for landing. After the Landing Checklist was completed, the captain disarmed the auto ground spoiler system with the intention of applying manual ground spoilers after landing. The auto braking system was also not armed prior to landing.The final approach and touchdown to runway 15 Left at Riyadh were uneventful. The touchdown airspeed was 135 knots calibrated air speed (CAS). On touchdown, the captain manually extended the spoiler/speed brake lever, but did not latch it in the fully extended (EXT) position (fully aft and latched upwards). The captain then removed his right hand from the speed brake lever in order to deploy the thrust reversers. The first officer noted the movement of the spoiler/speed brake lever and called ""Spoilers Deployed"". Since the spoiler/speed brake lever was not fully pulled aft and latched upwards, the lever automatically returned to the forward retracted (RET) position. This movement of the spoiler/speed brake lever was not noticed by the captain and the first officer. In response, the ground spoilers re-stowed before being fully deployed and, a speed brake/flap configuration (SPD BRK/FLP CONFIG) Level 1 Amber Alert occurred. This alert occurred as the aircraft was not yet fully weight on wheels (WOW) and the aircraft still sensed a flight condition with speed brakes deployed and flaps extended beyond six degrees.Six seconds after touchdown on the right main landing gear, the nose gear touched down and the aircraft transferred to a ground condition (WOW on nose gear and main wheel spin up). The SPD BRK/FLP CONFIG alert extinguished when the nose gear oleo actuated ground shift on landing. After touchdown, the aircraft banked to the right and began to drift right of the runway centerline. In response, he applied left rudder, deployed the thrust reversers and applied left aileron.But this did not have any noticeable effect.The captain saw the approaching G4 taxiway exit and in an attempt to keep the aircraft from leaving the runway surface beyond the G4 taxiway exit, he decided to direct the aircraft towards the taxiway. He then applied a right rudder input which caused the aircraft to commence a rapid sweeping turn to the right towards the G4 taxiway exit.The aircraft left the runway at high speed, traversed the full width of the G4 taxiway, and exited the surface at its southern edge. The aircraft then entered a sand section and travelled the distance infield between the edge of the G4 taxiway and the adjacent section of taxiway GOLF. The left main landing gear collapsed during this time. The aircraft came to rest on taxiway GOLF.There was no post impact fire.",15:58,2 IAE V2528-D5,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,SV9061,,,,,,,

Aria Air Flight 1525 was 22 km out and flying at an altitude of 7000 feet when the air traffic controller requested the crew to reduce speed in order to maintain separation with a preceding flight. The captain decided to perform an orbit. After continuing the approach the navigator reported the distance to the runway. At 5 km out the navigator began reading the checklist without the captain's command. There were no verbal responses.Airspeed along the glide path was 325 km/h, which was 50 km/h more than the assigned speed for a landing weight of 93 tons. The rate of descent was 10 m/sec. The airplane crossed the runway threshold at a height of 31 m and a speed of 310 km/h. At a height of 22 m the flight engineer shifted trust reversers to a reverse thrust position without a captain's command. He stowed the reversers again shortly before touchdown. The aircraft touched down on runway 21L at a speed of 275 km/h at a distance of 1000 m past the threshold, with about 2800 m remaining.The copilot then called for reverse, without monitoring the position of the reverse levers. The flight engineer, without checking the thrust reverse lever position and trust reversers position indication, set the throttles of engines 1 and 4 at the maximum trust. The two inner engines, no. 2 and 3 were shut down by the flight engineer. Emergency braking was applied when the crew noted that the aircraft was not decelerating as expected. Braking however was ineffective. The aircraft ran off the end of the runway at a speed of 200 km/h, deviated to the right after the front right wheel tire blew out. Further on, it broke some approach lights with a concrete base and crossed the net barrier. The nose landing gear broke off and the aircraft traversed a ditch at a speed of 185 km/h. When the left main gear entered the ditch, the aircraft swung left and slammed into a wall. The nose of the aircraft collided with the concrete foundation of the 2,5 m high brick wall at a speed of 120 km/h. As a result of the impact the cockpit andforward fuselage up to the 6th seat row were destroyed.

The aircraft was cleared for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach runway 11. The prevailing weather conditions at the time were overcast in light rain. The aircraft touched down in the area of the fourth landing marker. At the end of the runway veered to the right and went past the ILS localizer. The aircraft collided with eleven approach lights before it burst through the aerodrome perimeter fence, with the aircraft coming to rest in a nose down attitude on a public road.Runway 11 is a 2000 x 45 meters asphalt runway.

There were six crew members and 148 passengers on board. Fourteen passengers sustained serious injuries.Flight 331 operated on a scheduled service from Washington-Ronald Reagan National Airport, DC (DCA) to Kingston with an intermediate stop at Miami International Airport, FL (MIA). The flight left Miami at 20:52. The flight crew reported that they briefed for arrival at Kingston prior to commencing descent from FL370. During the briefing for the approach they decided that, based on the weather and the minimums for the straight in approach to runway 12, it was a better option to do the straight in and land on 12 with a tailwind, rather than doing a circling approach to runway 30 with a low ceiling, and that this had more likelihood of a successful outcome.The flight crew believed that if the runway was more than 8,000 feet, and the tailwind was 15 knots or less, on a wet runway it was not necessary to calculate landing distance before each landing. Since runway length at Kingston was 8,900 feet no calculations were made.Descent clearance was received at 21:51. At 22:03 the flight contacted the Approach controller, stating that they were descending out of FL190 for 15,000 feet.The Approach controller responded advising AA331 that they should expect an ILS runway 12 approach, gave the altimeter setting as 1014 mb, and cleared the aircraft to descend to and maintain one five thousand feet. Weather was reported as ""visibility five miles and there is moderate rain at the station ... wind three two zero at one zero knots...""At 22:14 the Approach controller cleared AA331 to maintain four thousand feet, and on reaching KEYNO cleared for a straight in ILS approach runway 12, and advised that the wind was now 320 degrees at 15 knots.AA331 contacted the Manley Tower controller at 22:17, reporting inbound on the ILS for runway 12, level at 2,800 feet. The Tower controller responded advising them of the wind as 320 at 12 knots, and asked if they were still requesting runway 12. AA331 responded affirmatively and asked for the wind again. The Tower controller responded with the wind at 320 at 14 knots. The Tower controller then cleared AA331 to land on runway 12, and stated ""... be advised runway wet"". The flight crew started getting ground contact intermittently below 2,000 feet, and consistently below 1,500 feet. The aircraft broke out from the clouds at about 1,000 feet and had the runway in sight, which was well above minimums for that approach, and maintained visual contact with the runway throughout the approach. They were still receiving rain, and the wipers were turned on. The aircraft was configured early at 1,000 feet, and was on the ILS glide slope. The first officer was monitoring the tailwind on the navigation display and the tailwind component was dropping as they descended to the final approach fix, where it was about an 8-9 knot tailwind.At about 550 feet, the captain disconnected the autopilot and left the auto throttle engaged.The localizer of the ILS serving runway 12 was offset three degrees north of the runway track, and hence did not bring landing traffic to the touchdown point, so at the pilot had to transition to approach and runway lighting cues and make a very slight left turn to line up with the runway centerline. The aircraft was equipped with a Heads Up Display (HUD), which the captain used for final approach and landing.The airplane crossed the runway threshold. The captain made nose-up control inputs at approximately 70 feet RA and manually disconnected the auto throttle at about 35 feet above the runway and closed the throttles to idle.The FDR data showed the aircraft pitching slightly nose up as it passed the threshold at about 70 feet radio altitude (RA), which reduced the descent rate. The captain turned off the autothrottle manually as the nose pitched up, about 4 seconds after threshold crossing, and the throttle levers were reduced to the flight idle stop about 14 seconds after threshold crossing, which was 3,800 feet down the runway.The float continued as the aircraft passed the PAPI lights at about 38 feet RA, where it should have been on the ground in a normal landing. The shallow rate of descent was maintained for about ten seconds until touchdown, which occurred at 4,100 feet down the runway, or 1,130 feet beyond the touchdown zone, as defined by AA Flight Manual.At least two pitch-up control wheel inputs were recorded by the FDR during the prolonged flare. The aircraft touched down at 148 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and 162 knots ground speed, with a 14 knot tailwind component and a 7 knot crosswind component from the left.The spoilers deployed at wheel spin up on the first touchdown, the aircraft bounced once and then landed again 200 feet down the runway, then autobrake 3 activated at about 4,600 feet from the threshold. The first officer called the ground spoiler, deployment and reverse thrust engagement.The captain stated that the aircraft was not decelerating as expected using autobrake 3 and he overrode the autobrake system, applying maximum manual braking on the brake pedals, and selecting maximum reverse thrust with the thrust levers. He was joined by the first officer simultaneously applying maximum manual braking on the brake pedals.The wheel marks on the runway indicated that the aircraft nose wheel drifted about twenty feet (six metres) left of centerline as the aircraft approached the end of the runway. The flight crew was unable to stop the aircraft on the remaining runway and the aircraft exited the end of the runway at 62 knots ground speed. The aircraft then passed through the chain link airport perimeter fence, crossed above the road located about 12 feet below the embankment at the end of the runway and came to rest on the sandy and rocky shoreline area located there, east of the airport boundary. There was no warning of the impending impact, and no brace command was given. The flight crew reported that after the aircraft came to a stop the cockpit was dark, and they completed the emergency evacuation checklist.",22:22,2 CFMI CFM56-7B27,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),3 m (10 feet) amsl,AA331,24610,,,,10402,,

The pilot, copilot, and two passengers were uninjured.The pilot filed an instrument-flight-rules (IFR) flight plan with the destination and alternate airports, both of which were below weather minimums. The pilot and copilot departed from Des Moines Airport in weather minimums that were below the approach minimums for the departure airport. While en route, the destination airport's automated observing system continued to report weather below approach minimums, but the flight crew continued the flight. The flight crew then requested and were cleared for the instrument landing system (ILS) 31 approach and while on that approach were issued visibilities of 1,800 feet runway visual range after changing to tower frequency. During landing, the copilot told the pilot that he was not lined up with the runway. The pilot reportedly said, ""those are edge lights,"" and then realized that he was not properly lined up with the runway. The airplane then touched down beyond a normal touchdown point, about 2,800 feet down the runway, and off the left side of the runway surface. The airplane veered to the left, collapsing the nose landing gear. The company's procedures did not allow flight crew to depart to an airport that was below minimums but did allow for the flight crew, at their discretion, to perform a ""look-see"" approach to approach minimums if the weather was below minimums.

Witnesses on the ground and on board reported that engine reverser sound was not heard during landing roll. During the landing roll, the aircraft veered to the left about 140 meters from the end of runway 35, then overran the departure end of runway 35. It came to a stop 205 meters beyond the end of the runway in a narrow river; the Rendani River.The airport rescue and fire fighting unit was immediately deployed to assist the post-crash evacuation. Due to the steep terrain 155 meters from the end of runway 35, the rescuers had to turn back and use the airports main road to reach the aircraft. The accident site was in an area of shallow muddy water surrounded by mangrove vegetation.Rendani has a single runway, 17/35, measuring 2.000 m x 30 m.",10:55,2 CFMI CFM56-3C1,,,,MZ836,54759,,,,38485,,

The outbound flight IX-811 was uneventful and landed at Dubai at 23:44 hours Local Time. The airplane was serviced and refuelled. The same flight crew operated the return leg, flight IX-812. The airplane taxied out for departure at 01:06 LT (02:36 IST). The takeoff, climb and cruise were uneventful. There was no conversation between the two pilots for about 1 hour and 40 minutes because the captain was asleep. The First Officer was making all the radio calls.The aircraft reported position at IGAMA at 05:33 hours IST and the First Officer was told to expect an ILS DME Arc approach to Mangalore. At about 130 miles from Mangalore, the First Officer requested descent clearance. This was, however, denied by the ATC Controller, who was using standard procedural control, to ensure safe separation with other air traffic. At 05:46 IST, the flight reported its position when it was at 80 DME as instructed by Mangalore Area Control. The aircraft was cleared to 7000 ft and commenced descent at 77 DME from Mangalore at 05:47 IST. The visibility reported was 6 km. Mangalore airport has a table top runway. As the AIP India states ""Aerodrome located on hilltop. Valleys 200ft to 250ft immediately beyond paved surface of Runway."" Owing to the surrounding terrain, Air India Express had made a special qualification requirement that only the PIC shall carry out the take off and landing. The captain on the accident flight had made a total of 16 landings in the past at this airport and the First Officer had operated as a Co-pilot on 66 flights at this airport.While the aircraft had commenced descent, there was no recorded conversation regarding the mandatory preparation for descent and landing briefing as stipulated in the SOP. After the aircraft was at about 50 miles and descending out of FL295, the conversation between the two pilots indicated that an incomplete approach briefing had been carried out.At about 25 nm from DME and descending through FL184, the Mangalore Area Controller cleared the aircraft to continue descent to 2900 ft. At this stage, the First Officer requested, if they could proceed directly to Radial 338 and join the 10 DME Arc. Throughout the descent profile and DME Arc Approach for ILS 24, the aircraft was much higher than normally expected altitudes.The aircraft was handed over by the Mangalore Area Controller to ATC Tower at 05:52 IST. The Tower controller, thereafter, asked the aircraft to report having established on 10 DME Arc for ILS Runway 24.Considering that this flight was operating in WOCL (Window Of Circadian Low), by this time the First Officer had also shown signs of tiredness. This was indicated by the sounds of yawning heard on the CVR.On having reported 10 DME Arc, the ATC Tower had asked aircraft to report when established on ILS. It appears that the captain had realised that the aircraft altitude was higher than normal and had selected Landing Gear 'DOWN' at an altitude of approximately 8,500 ft with speed brakes still deployed in Flight Detent position, so as to increase the rate of descent. As indicated by the DFDR, the aircraft continued to be high and did not follow the standard procedure of intercepting the ILS Glide Path at the correct intercept altitude. This incorrect procedure led to the aircraft being at almost twice the altitude as compared to a Standard ILS Approach.During approach, the CVR indicated that the captain had selected Flaps 40 degrees and completed the Landing Check List. At 06:03 hours IST at about 2.5 DME, the Radio Altimeter had alerted an altitude of 2500 ft. This was immediately followed by the First Officer saying ""It is too high"" and ""Runway straight down"". In reply, the captain had exclaimed ""Oh my god"". At this moment, the captain had disconnected the Auto Pilot and simultaneously increased the rate of descent considerably to establish on the desired approach path. At this stage, the First Officer had queried ""Go around?""To this query from the First Officer, the captain had called out ""Wrong loc .. ... localiser .. ... glide path"". The First Officer had given a second call to the captain for ""Go around"" followed by ""Unstabilised"". However, the First Officer did not appear to take any action, to initiate a Go Around. Having acquired the runway visually and to execute a landing, it appears that the captain had increased the rate of descent to almost 4000 ft per minute. Due to this, there were numerous warnings from EGPWS for 'SINK RATE' and 'PULL UP'. On their own, the pilots did not report having established on ILS Approach.Instead, the ATC Tower had queried the same. To this call, the captain had forcefully prompted the First Officer to give a call of ""Affirmative"". The Tower controller gave landing clearance thereafter and also indicated ""Winds calm"".The aircraft was high on approach and touched down on the runway, much farther than normal. The aircraft had crossed the threshold at about 200 ft altitude with indicated speed in excess of 160 kt, as compared to 50 ft with target speed of 144 kt for the landing weight.Despite the EGPWS warnings and calls from the First Officer to go around, the captain had persisted with the approach in unstabilised conditions. Short of touchdown, there was yet another (Third) call from the First Officer, ""Go around captain...We don't have runway left"". However, the captain had continued with the landing and the final touchdown was about 5200 ft from the threshold of runway 24, leaving approximately 2800 ft of remaining paved surface.The captain had selected Thrust Reversers soon after touchdown. Within 6 seconds of applying brakes, the captain had initiated a 'Go Around', in contravention of Boeing SOP. The aircraft overshot the runway including the strip of 60 metres. After overshooting the runway and strip, the aircraft continued into the Runway End Safety Area (RESA) of 90 metres. Soon after which the right wing impacted the localiser antenna structure located further at 85 metres from the end of RESA. Thereafter, the aircraft hit the boundary fence and fell into a gorge.",06:05,2 CFMI CFM56-7B27/3,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),103 m (338 feet) amsl,IX812,7199,,,,2833,,

As the flight approached Manteo, the copilot obtained updated current weather information at twice. Both times the weather had deteriorated. The pilot in command (PIC) stated that they would fly one approach and take a look. If it did not look good, they would divert to Elizabeth City Regional Airport, NC.The flight crew received a GPS runway 23 approach, circle-to-land on runway 5. The airplane was initially fast on approach, and the copilot could not deploy approach flaps when the PIC requested, as the airspeed was above the flap operating range. The PIC subsequently slowed the airplane and the copilot extended flaps to the approach setting. The PIC also overshot an intersection but quickly corrected and was on course about 1 mile prior to the initial approach fix. The airplane crossed the final approach fix on speed (Vref was 104) and on altitude, with the flaps and landing gear extended. The copilot completed the approach and landing checklist items but did not call out items as the PIC preferred co-pilots complete checklists quietly. The PIC then stated that they would not circle-to-land due to the low ceiling; however, a landing on runway 23 would be ok as the wind was at a 90-degree angle to the runway and there was no tailwind factor.

The pilot checked to the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and switched off and back to on. The yaw damper light extinguished. The yaw damper light then illuminated for the second time. The pilot asked the engineer to come to cockpit to observe the problem.The aircraft departed Soekarno Hatta Airport, Jakarta at 10.12 LT for Supadio Airport, Pontianak.

There was an additional briefing item that the pilot had experiences that in this specific aircraft sometimes thrust reverser hard to operate and speed brake fails to auto deploy. The PF asked the PM to check the speed brake auto deployment after landing.The aircraft was instructed to make an ILS approach to runway 15. The weather was reported slight rain. During initial approach the pilot used auto pilot and initial configuration was set with flaps 5 and speed 180 knots. After captured the localiser at 1300 feet, the PF asked for landing gear, down flaps 15 and speed reduced to 160 knots. He aimed to set the flaps landing configuration as the glide slope captured.When the glide slope was captured, the auto pilot was failed to follow the glide and still maintain at 1300 feet. While the aircraft was on one dot above the glide slope, the PF switched off the auto pilot and auto throttle, to fly manually to capture the glide slope.The PF then asked for flaps 40 and landing checklist. As the flaps lever has been selected to 40, the flaps indicator indicated to 30 positions. The PF asked for landing speed in case the flaps could be moved further than 30. After completing the landing checklist, PM then reselected the flaps. At approximately 600 feet, flaps 40 were successfully selected.The aircraft touched down past the touchdown point. After touch down, the PF tried to select the thrust reverser, but it felt that the thrust reverser was hard to operate and the speed brake did not auto-deploy. No deceleration was felt by the crew. The PF then applied manual brakes, and selected speed brakes to be deployed manually. The reversers then deployed.

The accident airplane, N781C, suffered problems with the Nose Wheel Steering (NWS) and had a recurring history of brake system failures. The NWS problems were deferred by maintenance crew. The brake package was changed the day before the accident without troubleshooting the cause of the problems.On the day of the accident the flight crew had again reported problems controlling the airplane's direction on the ground.Maintenance crew then eliminated the pressure of the left brake package and bled the right brake system, again without troubleshooting the cause of the problems.While taxiing out for takeoff on the accident flight, the crew noted the braking problems persisted. Yet, the captain decided to continue the flight with known brake issues and a disconnected NWS. The landing on Andahuaylas Airport (ANS) runway 03 initially went fine. At a ground speed of 40 knots the airplane began to swerve to the left with increasing intensity. The crew applied right hand brakes and put the right hand engine in reverse.

However, during rollout he noted a lack of deceleration and more brake pressure was applied, with no discernable deceleration. The airplane's optional thrust reversers were not used; they had been previously rendered non-operational by company maintenance personnel and were therefore not functional. According to the PIC, he continued applying brake pedal pressure, and when the airplane was about 2,000 feet from the runway's end, it was still traveling about 100 knots.

The airplane incurred substantial left wing damage when the left main landing gear collapsed during the overrun. The purpose of the flight was a test flight following the installation of the airplane's interior prior to delivery of the airplane to its owner. The flight departed from Appleton about 10:10. The flight returned about three hours later.While the airplane was inside the final approach fix, an amber left side hydraulic quantity low crew alerting system (CAS) message illuminated. The pilot flying (PF) noticed the hydraulic fluid quantity decreasing. Subsequently, an amber left hydraulic system fail CAS message appeared. The pilot not flying (PNF) pulled out the checklist to accomplish the left hydraulic system failure procedures and then suggested a go-around because the landing runway was about 500 feet shorter than the recommended minimum runway length indicated in the checklist. The PF decided to land due to the hydraulic quantity indications, prior autopilot problems, and the airplane's landing configuration. The PNF turned on the auxiliary pump about 500 feet above ground level, and both the PF and PNF thought the auxiliary hydraulic system could support normal spoilers, brakes, and nosewheel steering. The PF selected right thrust reverser aft and began pressing the brakes, but he felt no braking action. He reached for the emergency brakes; however, he did not immediately apply them to slow the airplane because he decided that there was not enough distance remaining to stop the airplane on the runway. Therefore, he attempted to go around with insufficient runway remaining by advancing the throttles to the maximum continuous thrust setting. The PNF did not see the airspeed increase and believed that not enough runway remained to get airborne, so he pulled the throttles back to avoid a runway overrun. The airplane exited the runway and sustained substantial damage. A review of the cockpit voice recorder transcript indicated that, before the emergency, the flight crew did not maintain a disciplined cockpit environment that focused on operationally relevant discussion but instead repeatedly made reference to and discussed objects on the ground and other operationally irrelevant topics. The lack of a sterile cockpit did not promote crew coordination and communication and adherence to procedures, which would have helped mitigate this emergency.",13:15,2 Rolls-Royce BR700-710C4-11,,Repaired,,GLF16,10,,,,,,

There were three crew members on board and all escaped unhurt. The flight crew indicated that they delayed their takeoff due to high wind conditions. Once the winds were within limits, they reported that startup was normal. Prior to takeoff, they decided to add 5 knots to their rotation speed, and power up slowly and as smoothly as possible.The captain was the flying pilot. The first officer called critical engine failure recognition speed (V1) reference speed at 141 knots, and rotation speed (Vr) at 150 knots. The captain rotated the airplane, and it then lifted off about 7,000 feet down the 11,000-foot runway. About 20 feet above ground level (agl), the number two engine (left inboard) throttle lever slammed back to the idle position. The No. 2 engine pylon had separated from the left wing. The No. 2 engine nacelle and pylon assembly struck the No. 1 engine nacelle, causing the No. 1 engine inlet cowl to separate, which degraded the engines ability to produce thrust and resulted in a significant loss of thrust on the left side of the airplane.The flight crew reported that the airplane began to drift to the left and descend. The captain lowered the pitch slightly and leveled the wings just prior to the airplane contacting the runway. He informed the other crew members that they were going to put it back down. He placed the throttle levers in the idle position, and activated the speed brakes. The airplane departed the left side of the runway surface; the crew reported a couple of impacts and then one final violent impact prior to the airplane coming to rest in a wetland marsh.The flight crew had to force the cockpit door open due to debris that had piled up against it. They noted significant damage from the forward galley aft, and a large fire in the vicinity of the left wing. They opened the left main cabin door, and deployed the slide. They exited into the mud, and made it to dry land and away from the burning wreckage.Investigators examined the wreckage at the accident site. The observed debris field extended 4,120 feet on a heading of 218 degrees. The first pieces of wreckage found along the debris path were fragments of the number two (left inboard) engine pylon; they were just past taxiway Alpha 2, about 7,500 feet from the beginning of runway 21. The number one engine (left outboard) nose cowl was about 450 feet further into the debris field and left of the runway surface in the grass infield.The number two engine nose cowl was near the runway arresting gear on the left side of the runway at the 8,500 foot point. The number two engine was about 230 feet further, and on the left side of the runway surface.The airplane departed the asphalt surface near taxiway Alpha 1, which was 9,500 feet from the departure end of the runway. Ground scars continued through the grass infield to taxiway Alpha at the end of the runway. The number one engine was in the grass infield near taxiway Alpha.The main wreckage came to rest in a wetland marsh left of the runway overrun, and caught fire. Fire consumed the top of the cabin and the cockpit. The main wreckage consisted of the cockpit, cabin, right wing with the number three (right inboard) engine partially attached, empennage, and the inboard half of the left wing, which sustained thermal damage and was under water. Scattered debris aft of the main wreckage included the nose gear, remnants of the burned outboard left wing, right main landing gear truck, and number four (right outboard) engine.A visual examination of a fracture surface on the number two engine pylon inboard mid-spar support fitting determined that it was flat and discolored with an arcing terminus.The aircraft was registered and operated by Omega Air Inc., an air refueling contractor that uses specially-equipped and converted civilian airplanes to serve as air refueling platforms for the military.

The captain, who was the flying pilot, and two of the three passengers were not injured. The first officer and one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was registered to a private individual and operated by JetSuite. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed. The flight originated from San Jose, California, about 14:20 hours local time.Following an uneventful flight, the flight crew briefed the arrival to the destination airport and set the calculated landing speeds. The captain and the first officer reported that during final approach, it felt like the airplane was 'pushed up' as the wind shifted to a tailwind or updraft before landing near the runway number markings. Upon touchdown, the captain applied the brakes and thought that the initial braking was effective; however, he noticed the airplane was not slowing down. The captain applied maximum braking, and the airplane began to veer to the right; he was able to correct back to the runway centerline, but the airplane subsequently exited the departure end of the runway and traveled down a steep embankment. Recorded communication from the cockpit voice and data recorder (CVDR) revealed that during the approach to landing, the flight crew performed the landing checks, and the captain noted difficulty judging the approach. About 1 minute later, the recording revealed that the ground warning proximity system reported ""five hundred"" followed by a ""sink rate, pull up"" alert about 16 seconds later. Data from the CVDR revealed that about 23 seconds before weight-on-wheels was recorded, the airplane was at an indicated airspeed of about 124 knots and descending. The data showed that this approximate airspeed was maintained until about 3 seconds before weight-on-wheels. The recorded data further showed that the approach speed was set to 120 knots, and the landing reference speed (Vref) was set to 97 knots. Using the reported airplane configuration and the 3.5-knot headwind that was reported at the time of the approach and landing, calculations indicate that the Vref speed should have been about 101 knots indicated airspeed, which would have required a landing distance of about 3,112 feet. Utilizing the same airplane configuration and wind condition with the flights reported 124 knot indicated airspeed just before touchdown, the landing distance was calculated to be about 5,624 feet. The intended runway for landing was 5,132-feet long with a 1.9 percent downward slope gradient, and a 123-foot long overrun area.",15:52,2 Pratt & Whitney Canada PW617F-E,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,1052,,,,,,

There was no fire, and the flight crew was not injured.At approximately 15:00, the aircraft departed runway 05 at Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ) for a ferry flight to Buttonville. At 15:03, the Toronto ACC controller cleared the aircraft for a contact approach to runway 33, to begin the descent, and to keep the approach tight, as there was traffic to follow. At that point, the aircraft was approximately 3 nm from the airport, descending through 2600 feet asl with a ground speed of 230 knots, and heading towards the threshold of runway 33 on a tight left base.Then the crew was instructed to switch to the Buttonville tower frequency. The Buttonville tower controller provided altimeter information and cleared the aircraft to land on Runway 33. At this time, the aircraft was descending through 1400 feet asl with a ground speed of 210 knots, and was located approximately 0.3 nm from the inbound track to runway 33. The aircraft levelled out from the right turn and was heading in an eastward direction. It flew through the inbound track at a transverse angle of about 120° at approximately 1 nm final. In an attempt to regain the runway centreline, the aircraft banked left, exceeding 30° of bank. The aircraft overflew the runway centreline by approximately 0.3 nm.At 15:04, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) issued an aural alert to pull up. A missed approach was called by the FO in a low tone of voice and using non-standard phraseology. The captain responded, but continued the approach. Shortly afterwards, the GPWS sounded another aural alert to pull up.The aircraft was approximately 300 feet above ground level, 0.7 nm south of runway 33 and 0.3 nm east of the inbound track, in a left bank towards the runway threshold. The captain called for full flaps and banked the aircraft steeply to the right after regaining the runway centreline while on short final.The FO reminded the captain of the landing reference speed (Vref), 4 and twice called out Vref plus 5 knots.At 15:04:49, the aircraft touched down hard on the main landing gear in a nose-high attitude, then immediately departed the runway surface to the right. The ground speed during the runway excursion could not be determined, but was estimated to be less than 110 knots. The captain applied the brakes and initially attempted to steer the aircraft onto the runway using the rudder. However, due to the infield's grass surface, braking and steering responses were minimal. Although the tiller was available for nose-wheel steering, it is not normally used until the speed is below 80 knots.The aircraft traversed the grass infield to the intersection of taxiways Charlie and Bravo, continued onto taxiway Bravo, and struck a runway/taxiway identification sign before crossing the intersection of taxiways Bravo and Alpha. The aircraft struck the sign with the right side of the nose section, the inboard leading edge and the right-wing slats. The sign was struck with sufficient force that it was torn away from its base and came to rest behind the aircraft on the apron.

One serious and multiple minor injuries were reported among the 157 passengers and six crewmembers on board the plane.The flight departed Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago on a scheduled flight to Georgetown. The aircraft was cleared for an RNAV (GPS) approach to runway 06 at Georgetown. This is a 7,448-ft / 2,270-m long asphalt runway. There were no reported anomalies in the en-route profile, although during the descent the aircraft deviated to avoid some thunderstorm cells north and east of the airport. The reported visibility was 9000m. Light rain was encountered during the approach.The pilot reported that after visual contact was made and after crossing the Final Approach Fix (FAF), he disengaged the auto pilot and configured the aircraft for landing. The flight was normal until the aircraft was approaching the runway. Even before the aircraft was over the threshold, the captain commented that he was not landing here.As the flight continued over the runway, comments on the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), revealed that the captain indicated to the first officer that the aircraft was not touching down. A go-around call was made by the captain and acknowledged by the first officer, however three seconds elapsed and the aircraft subsequently touched down approximately 4700ft from the threshold of runway 06, leaving just over 2700 feet of runway surface remaining.Upon touchdown, brake pressure was gradually increased and maximum brake pressure of 3000psi was not achieved until the aircraft was 250ft from the end of the runway or 450ft from the end of the paved area.

There were no injuries among the three crew members and 44 passengers. The airplane was operating as United Express flight 3363 from Chicago-O'Hare (ORD). At 15:24, the terminal air traffic controller (ATC) advised the flight crew that it was starting to rain heavily. About 2 minutes later, the aircraft intercepted the glideslope for the ILS to runway 32. Final descent was initiated, the landing gear was extended, and the flaps were selected to 22°. Upon contacting the tower controller, the flight crew was advised that moderate rain had just started at the airport and the wind was reported as 310° magnetic at 10 knots.Later on in the approach the flaps were selected to 45°. The tower controller then advised the flight crew that the wind had changed to 320°M at 13 knots gusting to 20 knots. To compensate for the increased wind speed, the flight crew increased the VAPP to 140 KIAS.About 1 minute later, at 15:29, the aircraft crossed the threshold of runway 32 at about 45 feet agl, at an airspeed of 139 KIAS. As the aircraft crossed the runway threshold, the intensity of the rain increased, so the flight crew selected the windshield wipers to high. When the aircraft was about 20 feet agl, engine power was reduced and a flare was commenced.Just before touchdown, the aircraft encountered a downpour sufficient to obscure the crews view of the runway. Perceiving a sudden increase in descent rate, at approximately 5 feet agl, the captain applied maximum thrust on both engines. The master caution light illuminated, and a voice warning stated that the flaps were not in a takeoff configuration. Maximum thrust was maintained for 7 seconds.The aircraft touched down smoothly 2700 feet beyond the threshold at 119 KIAS; the airspeed was increasing, and the aircraft became airborne again. The aircraft touched down a second time at 3037 feet beyond the threshold, with the airspeed increasing through 125 KIAS. Airspeed on touchdown peaked at 128 KIAS as the nosewheel was lowered to the ground, and then the thrust levers were retarded to flight idle. The outboard spoilers almost immediately deployed, and about 8 seconds later, the inboard spoilers deployed. The aircraft was about 20 feet right of the runway centreline when it touched down for the second time.Once the nosewheel was on the ground, the captain applied maximum brakes. The flight crew almost immediately noted that the aircraft began skidding. The captain then requested the first officer to apply maximum brakes as well. The aircraft continued to skid, and no significant brake pressure was recorded until about 14 seconds after the outboard spoilers deployed, when brake pressure suddenly increased to its maximum. During this time, the captain attempted to steer the aircraft back to the runway centreline.As the aircraft skidded down the runway, it began to yaw to the left. Full right rudder was applied, but was ineffective in correcting the left yaw.At some point during the landing roll, the captain partially applied the emergency/parking brake (EPB), and when no braking action was felt, the EPB was engaged further. With no perceivable deceleration being felt, the EPB was stowed.The aircraft continued to skid down the runway until about 7500 feet from the threshold, at which point it started skidding sideways along the runway.At 15:30, the nosewheel exited the paved surface, 8120 feet from the threshold, at approximately 53 knots, on a heading of 271°M. The aircraft came to rest on a heading of 211°M, just off the left side of the paved surface. After coming to a stop, the flight crew carried out the emergency shutdown procedure as per the company Quick Reference Handbook (QRH), and consulted with the flight attendant on the status of everyone in the passenger cabin. The flight crew determined that there was no immediate threat and decided to hold the passengers on board.When the aircraft exited the runway surface, the tower activated the crash alarm. The CYOW airport rescue and firefighting (ARFF) services responded, and were on scene approximately 3 minutes after the activation of the crash alarm. Once ARFF personnel had conducted a thorough exterior check of the aircraft, they informed the flight crew that there was a fuel leak.The captain then called for an immediate evacuation of the aircraft. The passengers evacuated through the main cabin door, and moved to the runway as directed by the flight crew and ARFF personnel. The evacuation was initiated approximately 12 minutes after the aircraft came to a final stop.",15:29,2 Allison AE3007A1/2,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,3363,25655,,,,23335,Trans States Airlines,United Express

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR), flight plan was filed. The main landing gear touched down about 1,650 feet beyond the approach end of the runway. The nosegear then touched down 2.4 seconds later and about 2,120 feet beyond the approach end of the runway, with about 2,680 feet of runway remaining. The pilot in command stated that he then applied the brakes but thought they were not working; he had not yet activated the thrust reversers. He alerted the second in command, who also depressed the brake pedals with no apparent results. The PIC suggested a go-around and advanced the power levers from the idle position to the takeoff position. The second in command said it was too late, and the power levers were then returned to the idle position 6 seconds later. The power levers were moved to the reverse thrust position 8 seconds after that and remained in that position for the duration of the accident sequence; both thrust reversers deployed when commanded. During landing rollout the airplane departed the runway, crossed a 600-foot overrun, impacted the far side of a ditch, crossed a dirt road, cleared another ditch, and came to a stop 820 feet from the departure end of the runway. Although armed, the airbrakes did not deploy upon touchdown; the data available was inconclusive to determine what position the throttles were in at touchdown and why the airbrakes did not deploy.

The crew had a day stop in Olkiombo Airstrip before beginning their usual pick-up routine before returning back to Mombasa. The crew testified to have topped up 200 litres of fuel before departing Olkiombo for Kicha Tembo airstrip where they were to pick up four passengers and another 15 passengers from Musiara Airstrip. The first officer reported to have put one large bag at the nose luggage compartment while the rest of the lighter luggage was place at the rear luggage compartment.On the take off roll on Tembo's runway 08, the first officer, who was Pilot Flying, reported to have hit a bump half way down the runway and bounced. The aircraft hit a second bump and again went airborne prematurely. At that moment the crew reported to have heard a continuous stall warning horn. The pilot flying recalled the pilot monitoring retarding the throttles, an action which made him realize that they were aborting take off. The pilot monitoring reported that there was a bit of tug on the controls between the two of them with the first officer (PF) pushing the control column down for a nose down attitude and the captain (PNF) trying to ease the force on the control column. With very little runway length left, the aircraft veered to the right at the end of the runway and came to a stop approximately 300 meters from the threshold of runway 26.The nose gear assembly was ripped off by the rough terrain and the rest of the aircraft ploughed through the grass for another approximately 10 meters. The aircraft front belly section was severely damaged.",19:55,2 Walter M-601E,,,,,,,,,,,

The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The occurrence flight was chartered by a travel agency on behalf of a wilderness adventure ski lodge. It was a regularly occurring charter flight between Vancouver and Blue River, BC, Canada.The travel agent verbally passed weather information to the flight crew. The captain understood that the runway had been plowed the previous day, and that the weather had been good that morning in Blue River.Before departing Vancouver, the flight crew had also obtained official weather data from regular flight planning sources. It was noted that although current conditions at Blue River were good, a weather system was moving northbound, and conditions in the area of Kelowna, Kamloops (CYKA) (the alternate), and Blue River would begin to deteriorate. As the flight progressed, the ski lodge radio room operator overheard the flight crew discussing weather conditions with a local helicopter pilot on the ATF as the flight overflew Blue River, but the operator did not have any direct contact with the flight. The crew was satisfied with the information received from the helicopter pilot regarding local weather.Because the Blue River aerodrome does not have a published instrument approach procedure, the intention was to fly over the aerodrome and proceed under visual flight rules (VFR) into the aerodrome. The flight progressed as planned until the aircraft passed overhead Blue River at the lowest useable IFR altitude, and the pilot was not able to descend under VFR into Blue River.The pilot then climbed back up to an enroute IFR altitude and continued to Valemount Airport under IFR. After conducting the IFR approach into Valemount and finding the weather suitable for flight under VFR, the aircraft completed the 60-nautical mile (nm) trip back to Blue River visually. The aircraft slowly descended in steps as it flew south towards Blue River at a reduced cruise speed of approximately 175 knots. As the aircraft neared the aerodrome, the pilots descended to altitudes as low as 1100 feet above ground level (agl) to maintain visual contact with the ground in deteriorating weather. Approximately 4 nm from the aerodrome, and 85 seconds before touchdown, control was transferred from the first officer (FO) to the captain, who became the pilot flying (PF).During the approach, the crew rushed to complete the pre-landing checks, visually acquire the runway, and manoeuvre the aircraft to land. The captain turned slightly to the left, away from the runway centreline. At this point, the FO called visual contact with the runway, and the captain turned right, back towards the runway centreline, and again passed through the runway centreline. The captain did not acknowledge that the runway was in sight.The aircraft was configured for landing 25 seconds prior to touchdown. As viewed from the pilot's perspective, the aircraft was to the left of centreline. Several seconds later, the aircraft initiated a right turn to line up with the centreline of runway 19, but actually crossed to the right of the centreline. The aircraft then overflew several buildings on the right of the runway centreline, approximately 75 feet adjacent to the runway threshold. The aircraft then turned sharply to the left as it passed abeam the threshold, then sharply right to acquire the centreline before touching down approximately 2000 feet past the threshold. Immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered left into the snow bank.During the last 23 seconds of the flight, the FO broadcast a traffic advisory to indicate that the aircraft was on final, made 3 speed calls, and advised the captain that the runway was to the left. There were no remarks made by the captain since the request for the landing checklist. The FO did not declare an unstable approach, or prompt the captain to execute a missed approach.",11:29,,,,,,,,,,,,

Destination was Abidjan, Ivory Coast, with a stop at Accra-Kotoka International Airport. On the descent into Accra, the aircraft was cleared by Accra Approach initially to FL050 and later cleared to 2000ft. It was again instructed to climb to 3000ft due to high ground. On arrival at Accra, the captain flew an Instrument Landing System (ILS) coupled approach, until he saw the runway. He then disconnected the autopilot at 500ft and manually flew the aircraft. After disconnecting the auto-pilot, he came into heavy IMC conditions in rain. The aircraft experienced an unstable approach at a high speed of 167kts and landed with a wind of 050/15kts at an airspeed of 154kts and about 5807ft from the threshold of runway 21 and 4000ft from the threshold of the runway 03 in nil visibility.

All three occupants were killed.The aircraft initially arrived at Nice-Côte d'Azur Airport (NCE) following a flight from Istanbul-Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, Turkey. Three passengers deplaned at Nice. Since the parking area at Nice was full, the airplane was to be ferried to Le Castellet. Takeoff was accomplished at 14:56 hours local time and the aircraft climbed to FL160 for a short flight to Le Castellet.At the destination, the crew was cleared to perform a visual approach to runway 13. The autopilot and the auto-throttle were disengaged, the gear was down and the flaps in the landing position. The GND SPOILER UNARM message, indicating nonarming of the ground spoilers, was displayed on the EICAS and the associated single chime aural warning was triggered. This message remained displayed on the EICAS until the end of the flight since the crew forgot to arm the ground spoilers during the approach. At a height of 25 ft, while the aircraft was flying over the runway threshold slightly below the theoretical descent path, a SINK RATE warning was triggered. The pilot flying corrected the flight path and the touchdown of the main landing gear took place 15 metres after the touchdown zone, which is 365 metres from the threshold, and slightly left of the centre line of runway 13. The ground spoilers, not armed, did not automatically deploy. The crew braked and actuated the deployment of the thrust reversers, which did not deploy completely. The hydraulic pressure available at brake level slightly increased. The deceleration of the airplane was slow. Four seconds after touchdown, a MASTER WARNING was triggered. A second MASTER WARNING was generated five seconds later.The nose landing gear touched down for the first time 785 metres beyond the threshold before the aeroplane's pitch attitude increased again, causing a loss of contact of the nose gear with the ground. The aircraft crossed the runway centre line to the right, the crew correcting this by a slight input on the rudder pedals to the left. They applied a strong nose-down input and the nose gear touched down on the runway a second time, 1050 metres beyond the threshold.The speedbrakes were then manually actuated by the crew with an input on the speed brake control, which then deployed the panels.

The captain was pilot flying. This was the fifth and last flight of the day for the crew.At 21:00, just prior to descent, the crew listened to ATIS information Whisky, which indicated that runway 07 was in use with a PAR procedure. Four minutes later the controller at Lorient reported that winds were from 160° at 17 kt with gusts to 26 kt. The flight then requested an ILS approach to runway 25 (CAT I), which was approved.At 21:10, the controller repeated the wind conditions and reported that ""the runway is wet with puddles (mouillée avec flaques deau)"" and that the preceding aircraft had difficulties during landing due to aquaplaning. Shortly thereafter, the controller reported showers at the airfield and the visibility had decreased to 2000 m.At 21:12, the crew was cleared to descend to 3000 ft. The controller stated that a runway inspection found that the runway was ""wet with puddles"", repeating the information about the previous landing.At 21:20, the aircraft was established on the ILS at an altitude of about 1900 ft and a speed of 180 kt.

The captain, copilot, flight engineer and two flight attendants were killed. The remaining three crew members sustained serious injuries.The airplane departed Pardubice Airport (PED), Czech Republic about 11:10 local time as Red Wings Airlines flight RWZ9268 to Moskva-Vnukovo Airport (VKO). Flight 9268 approached from the north and was cleared for landing on runway 19. The airplane was fully configured for landing with flaps at -37°, slats at -23°, and landing gear down. Decision height was 60 metres and the planned final approach speed was 210 km/h (113 kts).The final approach was flown in director mode with disabled automatic throttle. The approach was flown unstabilized at a speed of 255 km/h (138 kts) without significant deviations from the glide path. The airplane passed the runway threshold at a height of 15 meters (50 ft) and an airspeed of 260 km/h (140 kts).The throttles were moved to the 'idle' position and the airplane touched down at a speed of 230 km/h (124 kts), at a distance of about 900 - 1000 m (2950-3280 ft) from the threshold of the 3060 m (10.040 ft) long runway.The aircraft touched down on the left hand main gear first while the wind was gusting to about 11,5 m/sec. When the nose gear touched down, the right hand undercarriage strut had not yet compressed.Immediately the crew moved the throttle levers to ""maximum reverse"". The thrust reversers did not deploy. Also, the air brakes and spoilers did not deploy automatically.After selecting maximum reverse, thrust was increased to 90% (nominal operation). The minimum speed on landing was 200-205 km/h (108-111 kts). After that the speed increased to 240 km/h (130 kts). The increase in speed led to additional ""unloading"" of the main landing gear. The airplane rolled left and right but there was no simultaneous touchdown of both main landing gears. The pilots used the brakes but they were ineffective because the pressure in the wheel brakes is only applied when both landing gear struts are compressed. Five seconds after switching off the ""maximum reverse"", the flight engineer requested the reversers be activated again. Maximum reverse was selected again with the engines spooling up to 84% thrust. The reversers still failed to deploy. Thirty-two seconds after touchdown the airplane had reached the end of the runway. It crossed the runway threshold at a speed of 215 km/h (116 kts). The flight engineer shut down the engines at the request of the captain. Then both landing gear struts compressed, causing the automatic release of air brakes and spoilers as well as the deployment of the thrust reversers. The distance between the end of the runway and the M3 highway embankment is about 320 m (1050 ft) on downsloping terrain with a sharp dropoff of 10 metres (33 ft) at the embankment. The airplane collided with the embankment at a speed of 190 km/h (103 kts).

Departure time was 13:06 hours local time. From the cockpit voice recorder it was evident that the flight crew failed to brief or discuss the weather for departure or enroute. Additionally, they failed to complete several important checklists as required and did not observe sterile cockpit procedures during startup, run-up, taxi and takeoff. The enroute and approach checklists were not conducted prior to arriving near their destination of Marsh Harbour Airport, Bahamas. The crew was aware of the weather conditions at Marsh Harbor, which included heavy rainshowers; however, they never formulated a plan for diversion if the weather was bad at their time of arrival.As the approach continued there were constant disagreements between both pilots as to who had the runway in sight. Due to the weather conditions, visibility of the runway was intermittent, yet the crew continued descending visually in an attempt to land the aircraft on a runway that was not in sight and not served by an instrument landing system (ILS).The crew flew a non-stabilized approach and speed was not constant as they kept increasing and decreasing speed throughout the final approach. The captain, who initially was the non-flying pilot, while on final approach and below 500 feet AGL, assumed control of the aircraft from the flying pilot (first officer). At some point the captain lost use of his windshield wiper as it went over-center and was stuck. During the final moments of the approach. The copilot again assumed control of the aircraft and seconds before touch down, the captain (despite having no visual contact with the runway due to the intense downpour of rain and the non-use of his windshield wiper), again took control of the aircraft from the first officer.By the time the aircraft touched the runway, there were several control wheel exchanges between both pilots while neither had a visual of the runway.The aircraft initially touched down at 17:49:02 with a recorded vertical load factor of +2.16G, approximately 14 seconds after crossing the threshold of runway 09. Upon initial landing however, the aircraft bounced and became airborne, reaching a calculated maximum height of approximately 15 feet AGL.The aircraft bounced a second time at 17:49:07 with a recorded vertical load factor of +3.19G. During this second bounce, the pitch attitude was 1.8 degrees nose down, heading 102 degrees magnetic and airspeed 106 KIAS.The aircraft made consecutive contact with the runway approximately three times. The third and final bounce occurred at 17:49:14 with a recorded vertical load factor of +3.66G. During the third bounce, the pitch attitude was 2.2 degrees nose down, heading 099 degrees magnetic and airspeed 98 KIAS.As a result of the hard touchdown, damage was sustained to the right wing and right hand engine/propeller. The right hand engine parameters recorded a rapid loss of power with decreasing engine speed and torque, and subsequent propeller stoppage. The aircraft veered off to the right at approximate time of 17:49:20 on a heading of 131 degrees magnetic at a point approximately 6,044 feet from the threshold of runway 09.The recorded airspeed was 44 KIAS with the left hand engine torque at 26 % and the right hand engine torque at 0%.

At 70 feet RA, the auto pilot was disengaged and the aircraft was manually flown by the captain until touchdown.From 35 feet RA until before touchdown the wind shifted direction within the left rear quadrant and this time coming from 060 degrees to 112 degrees at increasing speed from 05 knots to 12 knots. Two seconds before touchdown the aircraft's true heading, which was initially at 240 degrees, changed to 230 degrees with groundspeed decreasing to 119 knots, drift angle increasing from +1 degree until +9 degrees just before touchdown.

During taxi at Port Moresby, the anti-skid warning light illuminated. The flight crew stopped the aircraft, carried out the relevant checklist, and determined from the aircraft performance charts that it was permissible to land at Madang with the anti-skid inoperative. The flight to Madang was normal and the aircraft landed there at 07:32. While on the ground, the freight from Port Moresby was off-loaded and a cargo consisting entirely of cigarettes, packaged in large cardboard cartons, was loaded for Tabubil and Port Moresby.The aircraft taxied to depart from runway 25 at 09:15. The flight crew used the full length of the runway and the takeoff roll was normal until the Pilot-in-Command, who was the handling pilot, tried to rotate at VR (which the flight crew had calculated to be 102 knots). The controls felt very heavy in pitch and he could not pull the control column back in the normal manner. After approximately two seconds the Pilot-in-Command aborted the takeoff and selected full reverse thrust, and he later applied full braking. It was not possible to stop the aircraft before the end of the runway and it continued over the embankment at the end of the runway and the right wing struck the perimeter fence. This caused the aircraft to yaw to the right and it entered a creek beyond the perimeter fence at approximately 45 degrees to its direction of movement. The aircraft came to rest in a small creek, with the forward 4/5 of the fuselage in the water and the cockpit mostly submerged. The right outboard wing section caught fire and the flight crew escaped through the hatch in the cockpit roof.

Flight GL-3205 originated in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. Three passengers were taken to the hospital for observation, there were no fatalities or serious injuries.On initial radio contact with Ilulissat AFIS, the flight crew got the information that runway 07 was in use. Weather information showed wind from 150° magnetic at 24 knots, maximum 33 knots, minimum 17 knots; a 24 knots cross wind, and a headwind of 5 knots. The wind at threshold runway 25 was gusting to 41 knots. Visibility was fine (10 km) with broken clouds at 12000 feet.The flight crew got visual contact with the Ilulissat area and due to the wind conditions and consequently expected turbulence on final, the flight crew prepared for a NDB/DME approach to runway 07 via JV NDB. Due to the cross wind conditions, the flight crew decided to do a landing with a flap setting of 15°. The flight crew asked Ilulissat AFIS for a confirmation of whether or not the cross winds of 24 knots included the gusting wind conditions up to maximum 33 knots. Ilulissat AFIS replied that the maximum wind was 35 knots and the cross wind was 26 knots. On a 5 miles final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to be 140° magnetic at 28 knots with a maximum of 35 knots and a cross wind of 26 knots. On short final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to 140° magnetic and 25 knots, maximum to 39 knots. Upon touchdown on runway 07, the left main landing gear collapsed. With the left main landing collapsed and after approximately 104 meters of runway rolling, the flight crew started to loose aircraft directional control. After approximately 389 meters, the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway and into the safety zone. The aircraft skidded sideways, hit the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) to runway 25, skidded down a steep slope and impacted a rocky area approximately 10 meters below the runway elevation. The crew members initiated an evacuation of the aircraft. The flight crew found the flight deck door jammed and evacuated the flight deck through the flight compartment emergency exit hatch.

The flight originated at Opa-locka, Florida (OPF), about 09:52.The two flight crewmembers reported that, after landing on runway 36, the pilot, who was the pilot flying, applied the brakes normally; however, the airplane did not decelerate as expected. The pilot applied the brakes a second time, and the right main landing gear tire subsequently failed. The airplane departed the end of runway 36 and came to rest in an area of unfinished gravel, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe. Examination of the 4,954-feet-long runway revealed that the airplane touched down about 1,400 feet from the approach end. Skid marks were visible for about 2,982 feet, and the tire failure occurred about 3,153 feet into the landing. Examinations revealed that the right main landing gear tire had a flat spot with a 4-inch diameter hole consistent with a locked brake. The airplane was equipped with an optional antiskid wheel braking system; however, it was disabled in 2004.The pilots reported that they decided to land on runway 36 based on the wind at flight level 180 and that they did not check the surface wind at the airport. The surface wind at the airport at the time of the accident was from 158 degrees at 15 knots gusting to 25 knots. Thus, the airplane landed with a significant quartering tailwind, which resulted in it touching down at a location and speed at which the pilots were unable to stop the airplane on the runway using normal braking.",10:37,,,Repaired,,,8736,,,,,,

All four passengers and three crew members were killed in the accident.During the engine start process, the flight crew neglected to disengage the airplane's gust lock system, which locks the elevator, ailerons, and rudder while the airplane is parked to protect them against wind gust loads. Further, before initiating takeoff, the pilots neglected to perform a flight control check that would have alerted them of the locked flight controls. A review of data from the airplanes quick access recorder revealed that the pilots had neglected to perform complete flight control checks before 98% of their previous 175 takeoffs in the airplane, indicating that this oversight was habitual and not an anomaly.A mechanical interlock between the gust lock handle and the throttle levers restricts the movement of the throttle levers when the gust lock handle is in the ON position. According to Gulfstream, the interlock mechanism was intended to limit throttle lever movement to a throttle lever angle (TLA) of no greater than 6° during operation with the gust lock on. However, postaccident testing on nine in-service G-IV airplanes found that, with the gust lock handle in the ON position, the forward throttle lever movement that could be achieved on the G-IV was 3 to 4 times greater than the intended TLA of 6°.During takeoff from runway 11 at Bedford-Hanscom Field, which is 2137 m (7011 feet) long, the pilot-in-command (PIC) manually advanced the throttle levers, but the engine pressure ratio (EPR) did not reach the expected level due to the throttles contacting the gust lock/throttle lever interlock. The PIC did not immediately reject the takeoff; instead, he engaged the autothrottle, and the throttle levers moved slightly forward, which allowed the engines to attain an EPR value that approached (but never reached) the target setting. As the takeoff roll continued, the second-in-command made the standard takeoff speed callouts as the airplane successively reached 80 knots, the takeoff safety speed, and the rotation speed. When the PIC attempted to rotate the airplane, he discovered that he could not move the control yoke and began calling out ""(steer) lock is on."" At this point, the PIC clearly understood that the controls were locked but still did not immediately initiate a rejected takeoff. If the flight crew had initiated a rejected takeoff at the time of the PICs first ""lock is on"" comment or at any time up until about 11 seconds after this comment, the airplane could have been stopped on the paved surface. However, the flight crew delayed applying brakes for about 10 seconds and further delayed reducing power by 4 seconds; therefore, the rejected takeoff was not initiated until the accident was unavoidable.The airplane thus failed to stop on the runway and continued onto the runway safety area and then the grass. The airplane continued on the grass, where it struck approach lighting and a localizer antenna assembly, before coming to rest in a gully, on about runway heading, about 1,850 feet from the end of the runway. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the airplane aft of the cockpit; however; all major portions of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site.

Before the flight, notices to airmen (NOTAMs) had been issued, which stated that the runway 14 threshold had been displaced 3,377 ft and that the instrument landing system and RNAV instrument approaches were not available. Although the NOTAMs were included in the flight release paperwork, dispatch personnel overlooked them, which resulted in flight planning numbers predicated on the full length of runway 14.During the approach, the pilots listened to the automatic terminal information service information and then became aware that runway 14 was shortened due to construction.Subsequently, the pilots calculated the landing distance required to land on a wet runway and chose to land on runway 1, which was the longer runway. The PIC reported that, during the approach, they encountered light rain but that the rain was moving away from the airport, which alleviated any concern regarding standing water on the runway.LandingThe SIC flew a stabilized approach 9 knots above the reference speed (Vref) and that the airplane touched down 903 ft from the runway threshold at a groundspeed of 118 knots. The SIC stated that he began braking with half pressure and continued to increase the brake pressure to maximum, which was the normal braking procedure, but that the airplane did not appear to be decelerating. The PIC informed the SIC that they needed to slow down, and the SIC replied that he had ""no braking."" The SIC then applied the emergency parking brake (EPB), but the airplane still did not slow down. FDR data indicated that the airplane achieved its maximum deceleration during the landing roll before the application of the EPB. FDR data showed that, once the SIC applied the EPB, the wheel speed dropped to 0. After determining that there was insufficient runway remaining for a go-around, the pilots realized that the airplane was going to exit the end of the runway. Subsequently, the airplane began to skid along the runway, which resulted in reverted-rubber hydroplaning, thus decreasing the stopping performance, and then exited the departure end of the runway and continued about 400 ft in soft terrain before it impacted a ditch and came to a stop.An examination of the brake system and data downloaded from the brake control unit indicated that the brake system functioned as commanded during the landing. Analysis of the runway surface and the amount of precipitation showed that there should have been no standing water on the runway. Landing distance calculations performed in accordance with the aircraft flight manual (AFM) showed that, even though the SIC exceeded Vref, the airplane should have been able to stop on the available runway. Braking friction According to the National Transportation Safety Board's airplane performance study, the maximum wheel braking friction coefficient achieved during the portion of the ground roll before the application of the EPB was significantly less than the maximum wheel braking coefficient that would have been expected given the unfactored wet-runway landing distances published in the AFM. However, the study determined that, if the EPB had not been engaged and airplane had maintained the braking friction level attained during the landing roll before the engagement of the EPB, it would have been able to stop on the available runway. Therefore, the SIC's application of the EPB, which locked the wheels, reduced the friction level, and decreased the braking performance, prevented the airplane from stopping on the available runway.Nonetheless, the braking friction deficit observed in this accident showed that the stopping performance of the airplane was more consistent with AFM landing distances for runways contaminated with standing water than for runways that were merely ""wet"" even though it was determined that the runway could not have been flooded.Since the accident, the operator has issued a flight operations bulletin instructing pilots to conduct a landing distance assessment using the AFM contaminated runway performance data for the lowest contamination depth when the following three conditions exist: 1) the runway did not have a treated surface, 2) thrust reversers were deferred or not installed, and 3) the airport was reporting rain or heavy rain.",08:47,2 Pratt & Whitney Canada PW535E,,Repaired,,,597,,,,,,

The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from Houston-William P. Hobby Airport, TX (HOU) to Sugar Land Airport.Following an ILS approach, the Sugar Land tower controller cleared the flight to land on runway 35. The airplane reached 50 ft above touchdown zone elevation (TDZE) at an indicated airspeed of 118 knots (KIAS). The airplane crossed the runway displaced threshold about 112 KIAS, and it touched down on the runway at 104 KIAS with about a 7-knot tailwind.About 1.6 seconds after touchdown of the main landing gear, the nose landing gear touched down and the pilot's brake pedal input increased, with intermediate oscillations, over a period of 7.5 seconds before reaching full pedal deflection. During this time, the airplane achieved its maximum wheel braking friction coefficient and deceleration. The cockpit voice recorder recorded both pilots express concern the that the airplane was not slowing. About 4 seconds after the airplane reached maximum deceleration, the pilot applied the emergency parking brake (EPB). Upon application of the EPB, the wheel speed dropped to zero and the airplane began to skid, which resulted in reverted-rubber hydroplaning, further decreasing the airplane's stopping performance. The airplane continued past the end of the runway, crossed a service road, and came to rest in a drainage ditch. Postaccident examination of the brake system and data downloaded from the brake control unit indicated that it functioned as commanded during the landing. The airplane was not equipped with thrust reversers or spoilers to aid in deceleration.The operator's standard operating procedures required pilots to conduct a go-around if the airspeed at 50 ft above TDZE exceeded 111 kts. Further, the landing distances published in the airplane flight manual (AFM) are based on the airplane slowing to its reference speed (Vref) of 101 KIAS at 50 ft over the runway threshold. The airplane's speed at that time exceeded Vref, which resulted in an increased runway distance required to stop; however, landing distance calculations performed in accordance with the AFM showed that the airplane should still have been able to stop on the available runway. An airplane performance study also showed that the airplane had adequate distance available on which to stop had the pilot continued to apply maximum braking rather than engage the EPB. The application of the EPB resulted in skidding, which increased the stopping distance.Although the runway was not contaminated with standing water at the time of the accident, the performance study revealed that the maximum wheel braking friction coefficient was significantly less than the values derived from the unfactored wet runway landing distances published in the AFM, and was more consistent with the AFM-provided landing distances for runways contaminated with standing water.It is likely that, based on the landing data in the AFM, the crew expected a faster rate of deceleration upon application of maximum braking; when that rate of deceleration was not achieved, the pilot chose to engage the EPB, which only further degraded the airplane's braking performance.",10:10,2 Pratt & Whitney Canada PW617F-E,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,RSP526,3854,,,,,,

At 20:24 hours, the crew was cleared to taxi to holding point J1 for a departure from runway 03. At 20:28, the aircraft was at the holding point and was cleared for takeoff by the controller. The aircraft taxied towards the runway from J1 but lined up with the runway edge lights, which were positioned 3 m to the right of the edge of the runway. The aircraft began its takeoff run at 20:30, passing over paved surface for approximately 248 m before running onto grass which lay beyond. The commander, who was the handling pilot, closed the thrust levers to reject the takeoff when he realised what had happened and the aircraft came to a halt on the grass having suffered major structural damage. The crew shut down the engines but were unable to contact ATC on the radio to tell the controller what had happened.The co-pilot moved from the flight deck into the passenger cabin and saw that no one had been injured. He vacated the aircraft through the rear baggage compartment and then helped the commander, who was still inside, to open the main exit door. The commander and the five passengers used the main exit to vacate the aircraft. Biggin Hill was originally a military airfield and at the beginning of runway 03 is a 250 m long and 36 m wide paved surface, with a 30° slant to the runway, called an Operational Readiness Platform (ORP). While there are no markings at the start of the ORP to indicate that aircraft should not enter this area, a section of the ORP between the runway and taxiway C has been painted with yellow hatching. Grass and weeds have grown in the gaps between the concrete segments in the ORP. Four surface-mounted red runway edge lights, evenly spaced 61 m apart, were positioned approximately 3 m from the white line that marked the edge of the runway. The most northerly light was located 30 m from the threshold of runway 03. Beyond the lights marking the runway threshold, white runway edge lights were mounted on poles located in the grass.",20:30,2 Rolls-Royce Spey 511-8,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,,,,,,,

The aircraft had been parked in the open overnight adjacent to the hangar.The pilot reported that the grass runway surface was wet but not unduly soft or frozen, with occasional spots of water-logging and mud. The wind was light and from an easterly direction making runway 15 the preferred runway direction for departure. Following the removal of engine and pitot covers, the engine was started and the aircraft positioned away from the hangar to an area at the beginning of runway 15. Following extension of full flap to permit proper inspection of the flap mechanisms, the engine was shut down and a pre-flight inspection was carried out. Engine start was completed and included a check of the propeller control to ensure the pitch changing mechanism was functioning correctly. Takeoff checks were completed from memory and the takeoff run was commenced on runway 15.With takeoff power applied the aircraft appeared to accelerate normally. The pilot used a soft field technique where aft pressure was applied to the control yoke and the nose-wheel was lifted just off the runway surface as soon as possible. With the aircraft well established in the takeoff run, the pilot felt that the aircraft was not accelerating as expected. As a reserve of take-off power was available, he applied maximum available engine power, however there appeared to be no appreciable increase in acceleration.The pilot realised that continuing the take-off in these circumstances was not safe and that stopping in the remaining runway length would likely result in an overrun. As he was familiar with the airfield he was also aware that any overrun would result in the aircraft entering the ditch at the end of the runway. With few options remaining at that point, the pilot attempted to overfly the ditch at the departure end of the runway with the intention of stopping the aircraft in the adjacent field. As it passed over the ditch, the aircraft made contact with fence posts embedded in the hedge sustaining significant damage to the left elevator and fuselage underside. The aircraft came to rest at the far boundary of the adjacent field, incurring damage to the engine and propeller. The pilot shut down the engine and was able to evacuate the aircraft unaided.",08:58,1 Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-114A,,Repaired,,,935,,,,,,

At 08:32 hrs G-LGNL was cleared to enter runway 18 at Stornoway Airport and take off, and the ATC controller transmitted that the surface wind was from 270° at 27 kt. The commander commented to the co-pilot that the wind was across the runway and that there was no tailwind. As the aircraft taxied onto the runway, the co-pilot applied almost full right aileron input consistent with a cross-wind from the right, and the commander said to the co-pilot ""charlie , one hundred, strong wind from the right"". The commander advanced the power levers, the co-pilot said ""autocoarsen high"" and the engine torques increased symmetrically. The commander instructed the co-pilot to ""set takeoff power"" to which the co-pilot replied ""apr armed"". Approximately one second after this call, the engine torques began to increase symmetrically, reaching 100% as the aircraft accelerated through 70 kt.During the early stages of the takeoff, left rudder was applied and the aircraft maintained an approximately constant heading. As the aircraft continued accelerating, the rudder was centralised, after which there was a small heading change to the left, then to the right, then a rapid heading change to the left causing the aircraft to deviate to the left of the runway centreline.The pilot applied right rudder but although the aircraft changed heading to the right in response, it did not alter the aircrafts track significantly and the aircraft skidded to the left, departing the runway surface onto the grass at an IAS of 80 kt. The power levers remained at full power as the aircraft crossed a disused runway and back onto grass. During this period the nose landing gear collapsed before the aircraft came to a halt approximately 38 m left of the edge of the runway and 250 m from where it first left the paved surface.After the aircraft came to a halt, the captain saw that the propellers were still turning and so called into the cabin for the passengers to remain seated. One of the passengers shouted for someone to open the emergency exit but the cabin crew member instructed the passengers not to do so because the propellers were still turning. The co-pilot observed that the right propeller was still turning so operated the engine fire extinguishers to shut down both engines. When the passenger seated in the emergency exit row on the right of the aircraft saw that the right propeller had stopped, he decided to open the exit. He climbed out onto the wing and helped the remaining passengers leave the aircraft through the same exit, instructing them to slide off the rear of the wing onto the ground. The left propeller was still turning at the time the right over-wing exit was opened and the passenger seated in the left-side emergency exit row decided not to open the left exit.The technique for controlling the direction of the aircraft on the runway is to use rudder assisted by nose wheel steering (NWS) at low speeds because the rudder has reduced effectiveness below 40 kt.When rudder is used, the requirement for NWS to assist directional control will reduce progressively as speed increases above 40 kt and rudder effectiveness increases. It is likely that no assistance will be required by 60 kt and, therefore, there will be no step-change in NWS directional effect when the pilot releases the steering control. During this attempted takeoff, rudder was approximately neutral from 40 kt, the point at which it would have become effective, and directional control was probably maintained through NWS alone (asymmetric thrust or differential braking having been discounted). If rudder had been applied, there would have been a reduced NWS requirement at any given speed and therefore there would have been a reduced likelihood of a change directional effect when the NWS control was released. The lack of data showing NWS commands meant that these considerations could not be verified.",08:33,2 General Electric CT7-9B,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,BE6821,,,Flybe,Loganair,,,

The airline transport pilot and co-pilot, 1 flight attendant, and 4 passengers were not injured, 1 passenger sustained serious injuries, and 1 passenger sustained minor injuries. The flight originated from MTH about 15:54.The pilot-in-command (PIC) stated that the landing dry and wet distances were calculated to be 3,166 and 4,166 feet, respectively. The flight departed MTH and while en route they obtained the MKY automated weather observing station (AWOS) which indicated the wind was from 250 degrees at 5 knots, and the visibility was 10 miles.The PIC further stated they reviewed the speeds (Vref of 133 knots), and planned a visual approach to runway 17. Air traffic control approved their request for a visual approach, and they changed to the common traffic advisory frequency, entering left downwind for runway 17. They slowed, lowered the flaps to 20 degrees, and noted rain 2 to 3 miles east of MKY, though the airport appeared to be dry.

The 2 pilots, 3 flight attendants, and 98 of the 127 passengers were not injured; the other 29 passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was substantially damaged. Flight 1086 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Atlanta-Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Georgia, where it departed at 09:23 hours local time. Given the winter weather conditions at LaGuardia, the flight crew was concerned about the available landing distance on runway 13 (7003 ft / 2135 m). While en route to LGA they spent considerable time analyzing the airplanes stopping performance.The flight crew also requested braking action reports about 45 and 35 minutes before landing, but none were available at those times because of runway snow clearing operations. The unavailability of braking actions reports and the uncertainty about the runways condition created some situational stress for the captain, who was the pilot flying.After runway 13 became available for arriving airplanes, the flight crews of two preceding airplanes (which landed on the runway about 16 and 8 minutes before the accident landing) reported good braking action on the runway, so the flight crew expected to see at least some of the runways surface after the airplane broke out of the clouds. However, the flight crew saw that the runway was covered with snow, which was inconsistent with their expectations based on the braking action reports and the snow clearing operations that had concluded less than 30 minutes before the airplane landed. The snowier-than-expected runway, along with the relatively short runway length and the presence of Flushing Bay directly off the departure end of the runway, most likely increased the captains concerns about his ability to stop the airplane within the available runway distance, which exacerbated his situational stress. The captain made a relatively aggressive reverse thrust input almost immediately after touchdown. Both pilots were aware that 1.3 EPR was the target setting for contaminated runways.As reverse thrust EPR was rapidly increasing, the captains attention was focused on other aspects of the landing, which included steering the airplane to counteract a slide to the left and ensuring that the spoilers had deployed, which was a necessary action for the autobrakes to engage. The maximum EPR values reached during the landing were 2.07 on the left engine and 1.91 on the right engine, which were much higher than the target setting of 1.3 EPR. These high EPR values likely resulted from a combination of the captains stress; his relatively aggressive reverse thrust input; and operational distractions, including the airplanes continued slide to the left despite the captains efforts to steer it away from the snowbanks alongside the runway. All of these factors reduced the captains monitoring of EPR indications. The high EPR values caused rudder blanking, which occurs on MD-80 series airplanes when smooth airflow over the rudder is disrupted by high reverse thrust, and a subsequent loss of aerodynamic directional control. Although the captain stowed the thrust reversers and applied substantial right rudder, right nosewheel steering, and right manual braking, the airplanes departure from the left side of the runway could not be avoided because directional control was regained too late to be effective.The airplane departed the left side of runway 13 about 3,000 feet from the approach end of the runway. The tracks were on a heading of about 10 degrees from the runway heading.About 4,100 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplanes left wing initially struck the airports perimeter fence, which is located on top of the berm, and the airplane tracks turn back parallel with runway 13. About 5,000 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplane came to rest with its nose over the berm. The left wing of the airplane destroyed about 940 feet of the perimeter fence.",11:02,2 Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,DL1086,71195,,,,54865,,

When the aircraft came in contact with Mangalore ATC, the controller cleared the aircraft direct to Hubli and informed heavy rains and thunder showers over Hubli with visibility 3000 m. At around 60 nm from Hubli, the weather reported was heavy rain and visibility 4000 meters. ATC cleared aircraft for the NDB approach runway 26, however the captain preferred to carry out a VOR/DME trial procedure for runway 26. The descent was commenced and about 25 nm short of Hubli, ATC again advised visibility has reduced to 3000 m due heavy rain and thunderstorm.Thereafter the crew decided to hold over Hubli until the weather improves. Twenty minutes into holding, ATC again informed that visibility has improved to 4000 m in moderate rain.Subsequently descent was requested by the pilot for runway 26. The captain stated that he had established visual reference with runway at about 6 nm on the final approach course. The crew also selected wipers on short final to have a better visibility. The aircraft landed normally. The captain stated that after touch down and reducing power, he was concentrating on the far end of the runway. As the runway was wet, he did not realize that the aircraft was drifting to the left of the center line. He further mentioned that he selected full reverse on both the engines to maintain the aircraft on the center line however the aircraft veered toward the left side of the runway and in the process overran the runway edge light, after which the left main landing gear collapsed. The propeller blades hit the runway surface and sheared off from the root attachment. The captain maneuvered the aircraft however the nose wheel tyre failed under over load conditions and the nose landing gear collapsed as well. Subsequently, the aircraft exited the runway on the left side on kutcha (dried mud) and came to a final stop at round 52 meters away from the runway center line. The cockpit crew shut down the engines and the electrical power supply and cockpit door and announced evacuation. The cabin crew opened and the cabin doors on the right for evacuation. There was no injury to any of the occupants on board the aircraft. There was no postaccident fire.",ca 19:30,2 Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150A,,,,SG1085,10224,,,,9440,,

The co-pilot performed the external checks; this included checking the fluid level in the hydraulic reservoir. The aircraft was refuelled to 3,000 lb and, after the passengers boarded, it departed for Blackpool. The commander was the pilot flying (PF).The takeoff and cruise to Blackpool were uneventful. The commander planned and briefed for the NDB approach to runway 10, which was to be flown with the autopilot engaged. Whilst descending through FL120, the left, followed by the right, hydraulic low pressure cautions illuminated. Upon checking the hydraulic pressure gauge, the pressure was noted to be cycling up and down, but for the majority of the time it indicated about 2,800 psi (in the green arc). During this time the hydraulic low pressure cautions went on and off irregularly, with the left caution being on more often than the right. The co-pilot then actioned the HYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILURE checklist. It stated that if the hydraulic pressure was a minimum of 2,800 psi, the flight could be continued.Just before the aircraft reached the Blackpool NDB, the commander commented ""its dropping"", but he could not recall what he was referring to. This was followed by the roll fail and speed brk [brake] fail caution messages illuminating. The co-pilot then actioned the applicable checklists. These stated that the Landing Distances Required (LDR) would increase by approximately 65% and 21%, respectively. As the roll fail LDR increase was greater than that of the speed brk fail, the crew used an LDR increase of 65% which the co-pilot equated to 5,950 ft. Runway 10 at Blackpool has an LDA of 6,131 ft, therefore they elected to continue to Blackpool.The roll fail checklist stated that a FLAPS UP landing was required. The co-pilot then calculated the VREF of 132 kt, including a 20 kt increment, as stipulated by the FLAPS UP, 10, OR 20 APPROACH AND LANDING checklist. The commander then continued with the approach.At about 4 nm on final approach the co-pilot lowered the landing gear, in response to the commanders request. About 8 seconds later the commander said ""just lost it all""; referring to the general state of the aircraft. This was followed almost immediately by the landing gear unsafe aural warning, as the main landing gear was not indicating down and locked. Whilst descending through 1,000 ft, at just over 3 nm from the threshold, the commander asked the co-pilot to action the ALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSION checklist.The commander then discontinued the approach by selecting ALT HOLD, increased engine thrust and selected a 500 ft/min rate of climb on the autopilot. However, a few seconds later, before the co-pilot could action the checklist, the main gear indicated down and locked. The commander disconnected the autopilot and continued the approach. The crew did not consider reviewing the HYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILURE checklist as they had not recognised the symptoms of loss of hydraulic pressure.When ATC issued the aircraft its landing clearance the wind was from 140° at 17 kt. This equated to a headwind component of about 10 kt and a crosswind of about 12 kt. As the aircraft descended through 500 ft (the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for the approach) at 1.5 nm from the threshold, the commander instructed the co-pilot to advise ATC that they had a hydraulic problem and to request the RFFS to be put on standby. There was a slight delay in transmitting this request, due to another aircraft on frequency, but the request was acknowledged by ATC.The aircraft touched down about 1,500 ft from the start of the paved surface at an airspeed of 132 kt and a groundspeed of 124 kt. When the commander applied the toe (power) brakes he felt no significant retardation. During the landing roll no attempt was made to apply the emergency brakes, as required in the event of a power brake failure. The co-pilot asked if he should try to operate the lift dump, but it failed to function, due to the lack of hydraulic pressure. At some point, while the aircraft was on the runway, the co-pilot transmitted a MAYDAY call to ATC. When an overrun appeared likely, the commander shut down the engines. The aircraft subsequently overran the end of the runway at a groundspeed of about 80 kt. The commander later commented that he was in a ""state of panic"" during the landing roll and was unsure whether or not he had applied the emergency brake.As the aircraft left the paved surface the commander steered the aircraft slightly right to avoid a shallow downslope to the left of runways extended centreline. The aircraft continued across the rough, uneven ground, during which the nose gear collapsed and the wing to fuselage attachments were severely damaged. Once it had come to a stop, he shut down the remaining aircraft systems. The passengers and crew, who were uninjured, vacated the aircraft via the entry/exit door and moved upwind to a safe distance.",11:48,2 Williams International FJ44-2A,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,,,,,,,

The pilot, who was the sole occupant was not injured. The aircraft took off from Tokyo-Haneda Airport at 14:41 local time on a ferry flight to Konan Airfield. The pilot switched from IFR to Visual Flight Rules (VFR) at about 15nm short of Kibi VOR. The aircraft passed over the vicinity of Saidaiji (the published visual reporting point, 6.7 nm northeast from the airfield) at an altitude of about 3,000 ft and a speed of about 200 kt at 15:41, and acquired information on the active runway and wind condition from Konan Flight Service.This was reported as runway 09, with a wind direction 090° at 5 kts, and the aircraft was requested to report on the left downwind leg. The captain remembered the wind condition being 4 kts from the south, and assessed both runway directions to be available. He thus requested to land using runway 27, which was a shorter flight path, and was requested to report at 2 nm short of runway 27 or on the base leg.The aircraft was configured for landing and at 15:44:59 the aircraft descended through 500 feet.The captain stated that he made straight-in approach at 117 kt, adding 10 kt as usual above the VREF displayed on the speed indicator to avoid stalling. According to EGPWS records, there was a warning ""Too Low, Flaps"" at 15:45:11 when the aircraft was at 205 ft AGL, with an airspeed 155 kt and ground speed 160 kt. This voice warning was repeated two times.EGPWS records showed the aircraft gradually reduced speed on the final approach, with the last record being at 87 ft AGL with an airspeed 142 kt and ground speed 147 kt.The main landing gears of the aircraft touched down forward of the aiming point marking. About half way down the runway the pilot noticed a bird and turned a little bit to the right to avoid the bird, which was flying away. The captain then strongly applied the brakes, but he did not feel the usual deceleration. Continuing to apply the brakes, the aircraft avoided the stopway edge lights to the right and entered a grass area; accordingly, it went into a pond used as a regulating reservoir located west of the runway at about 20 to 30 kts.

The aircraft operated on a flight from Milan-Malpensa Airport, Italy to Blackbushe, U.K.After descending through the London Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) it was handed over from London Control to Farnborough Approach. Its descent continued towards Blackbushe and, having reported that he had the airfield in sight, the pilot was instructed to descend at his own discretion. When the aircraft was approximately four miles south of its destination, he was instructed to contact Blackbushe Information.The weather at Blackbushe was fine with light and variable winds, visibility in excess of ten kilometres, and no low cloud.HZ-IBN entered the left-hand circuit for runway 25 via the crosswind leg. Towards the end of the downwind leg, it overtook an Ikarus C42 microlight aircraft, climbing to pass ahead of and above that aircraft. As the climb began, at approximately 1,000 ft aal, the TCAS of HZ-IBN generated a 'descend' RA alert to resolve a conflict with the microlight. The TCAS RA changed to 'maintain vertical speed' and then 'adjust vertical speed', possibly to resolve a second conflict with a light aircraft which was above HZ-IBN and to the east of the aerodrome. Neither the microlight nor the light aircraft was equipped with TCAS.Following this climb, HZ-IBN then flew a curving base leg, descending at up to 3,000 feet per minute towards the threshold of runway 25. The aircrafts TCAS annunciated 'clear of conflict' when HZ-IBN was 1.1 nm from the runway threshold, at 1,200 ft aal, and at a speed of 146 KIAS, with the landing gear down and flap 3 selected.The aircraft continued its approach at approximately 150 KIAS. Between 1,200 and 500 ft aal the rate of descent averaged approximately 3,000 fpm, and at 500 ft aal the descent rate was 2,500 fpm. The aircrafts TAWS generated six 'pull up' warnings on final approach. The aircraft crossed the runway 25 threshold at approximately 50 ft aal at 151 KIAS. The aircraft manufacturer calculated that the appropriate target threshold speed for the aircraft's mass and configuration was 108 KIAS. The AFISO initiated a full emergency as the aircraft touched down, because ""it was clear at this time that the aircraft was not going to stop"".Tyre marks made by the aircraft at touchdown indicated that it landed 710 m beyond the runway 25 threshold. The runway 25 declared Landing Distance Available (LDA) was 1,059 m; therefore the aircraft touched down 349 m before the end of the declared LDA. The paved runway surface extended 89 m beyond the end of the LDA.The aircraft continued along the runway, decelerating, but departed the end of the paved surface at a groundspeed of 83 kt (84 KIAS airspeed) and struck an earth bank, which caused the aircraft to become airborne again. It then struck cars in a car park, part of a large commercial site adjacent to the aerodrome. The wing separated from the fuselage, and the fuselage rolled left through 350° before coming to rest on top of the detached wing. A fire broke out in the underside of the aft fuselage and burned with increasing intensity.The aerodrome's fire services responded to the crash alarm but their path to the accident site was blocked by a locked gate between the aerodrome and commercial site. The first two vehicles arrived at the gate 1 minute and 34 seconds after the aircraft left the runway end.The third vehicle, which carried a key for the gate, arrived approximately one minute later, and the three vehicles proceeded through the gate 2 minutes and 46 seconds after the aircraft left the runway. As the aircraft was located in an area of the car park surrounded by a 2.4 m tall wire mesh fence, the vehicles had to drive approximately 400 m to gain access to the accident site. Despite applying all their available media, the fire service was unable to bring the fire under control. The intensity of the fire meant that it was not possible to approach the aircraft to save life.All four occupants of the aircraft survived the impact and subsequently died from the effects of fire.Among the passengers were the stepmother and sister of Osama bin Laden.",15:08,2 Pratt & Whitney Canada PW535E,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,2409,,,,1377,,

The flight originated from Wittman Regional Airport (OSH), Wisconsin, USA, about 12:20.According to the pilot, the approach to runway 26 ""required a steeper than normal approach,"" because of trees near the runway. The airplane touched down near the displaced threshold and he applied the brakes to decelerate; however, the ""first pedal push was soft,"" which was ""not unusual."" Then, he continued ""pumping the brakes"" and considered a go-around; however, the remaining runway was too short.

The airplane continued off the end of the runway, impacted a berm, and came to rest upright approximately 200 feet beyond the end of the runway.During the accident sequence, the right main landing gear punctured the underside of the right wing, which resulted in substantial damage. In addition, the nose landing gear separated from the airplane.According to data downloaded from the airplanes diagnostic storage unit (DSU), the airplane touched down 1,280 ft beyond the runway threshold, which resulted in 2,408 ft of runway remaining (the runway had a displaced threshold of 737 ft) and that it traveled 2,600 ft before coming to rest about 200 ft past the runway. Comparing DSU data from previous downloaded flights revealed that the airplanes calculated deceleration rate during the accident landing was indicative of braking performance as well as or better than the previous landings. Estimated landing distance calculations revealed that the airplane required about 3,063 ft when crossing the threshold at 50 ft above ground level.

The flight crew consisted of a captain and copilot, who were the only occupants of the aircraft.The flight crew did not detect anything abnormal during the taxi and take-off roll, until the captain attempted to rotate the aircraft to the take-off pitch attitude. When the aircraft had achieved the required rotate speed, the captain applied the normal backpressure on the control column to achieve a standard rate of rotation, and the aircraft did not rotate. The captain then applied full backpressure and reported that the controls felt very heavy. Neither the captain nor the copilot detected any change in the aircraft's pitch attitude or any indication of pitch-up on the attitude direction indicator.The captain rejected the take-off, applied full braking and reverse thrust, but the aircraft overran the runway. The nose landing gear detached from the aircraft about 50 m beyond the end of the sealed runway, and the aircraft came to rest in long grass and mud. The aircraft sustained substantial damage, and the captain and copilot were uninjured.The aircraft did not accelerate normally as the acceleration was retarded by drag associated with rolling friction. This was indicative of partial brake pressure remaining during the take-off run. The partial brake pressure was possibly due to the parking brake being selected on at the holding point with enough pressure to retard aircraft acceleration during the take-off, but not sufficient to prevent the aircraft reaching rotate speed.Furthermore, the nose-down moment generated by the partial brake pressure probably prevented the aircraft rotating sufficiently to become airborne, despite normal nose-up elevator deflection.Heat in the brakes due to partial pressure during the take-off run may have reduced their effectiveness when the captain rejected the take-off, contributing to the runway overrun.",13:00,,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,2768,,,,,,

Both crew members escaped uninjured.In preparation for a positioning flight to Río Gallegos the crew failed to connect an inverter, a component of the electrical system that converts the direct current from 28V to an alternating current of 115V, prior to starting engine no.1. This was then rectified.At 09:34 the aircraft taxied to the threshold of runway 05 for departure. The copilot was Pilot Flying while the experienced captain was Pilot Monitoring.Takeoff clearance was received at 09:40 and the power levers were advanced. During the takeoff roll the copilot noticed that the no.1 engine N1 reached a value of 101% instead of 95% like the no.2 engine. At that point the aircraft had already traveled 380 m. It began to drift to the right of the runway centreline. The copilot decided to abort without voicing his intentions. he brought back the power levers to idle and began applying brakes. At this point, LV-ZSZ had traveled approximately 980 meters from the start of the take-off run.The right engine power decreased to 30-40% N1 while the left engine continued at a value over 101% N1. The captain then took over control. Differential braking was applied to steer the aircraft back towards the runway centreline. Thrust reversers were deployed briefly but the aircraft ran off the side of the runway. The aircraft impacted with a ditch located 80 meters from the runway, causing the undercarriage to break away.  After coming to rest with both engines now at 20% N1, the engine were shut down.As a result of the impact, part of the left tip tank fuel tank had separated, causing a fire that destroyed the aircraft.The most likely cause of the uncommanded acceleration and subsequent overspeed condition was a contamination of retained particles present within the fuel control unit (FCU). The contamination was a short-lived random condition, as evidenced by the fact that after about 30 seconds the power lever regained control of the left engine.",06:40,2 Honeywell TFE731-2C-2B,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,12190,,,,9517,,

The flight took off from Karachi at 08:08 local time. The captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and first officer (FO) was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for the flight.The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Before initiating descent as per flight plan, the cockpit crew obtained latest weather of destination aerodrome Lahore which mentioned visibility 1200 meters. This visibility was below the minimum required (1600m) for carrying out a VOR/DME approach and necessitated decision for diversion to alternate aerodrome. The cockpit crew decided to continue for the destination. At 08:59 local time the flight changed over to Lahore ACC, which cleared the flight the VOR/DME approach to runway 36L. Latest weather was reported a visibility of 1200 meters. Since runway 36R was closed for maintenance, the crew planned to follow the ILS procedure for runway 36R with intention to break off after acquiring visual with the runway and landing on runway 36L. This was a non standard procedure.The first officer failed to establish radio contact with the first diversion alternate, Sialkot International Airport. At this time, the FO discussed with the captain that in case of diversion their alternate aerodrome was Peshawar which required additional fifty minutes of flying time.At 09:04 it was discussed if an RNAV approach could be flown and the captain told the FO to request an RNAV approach. However, the aircraft was not equipped with mandatory navigation equipment (GNSS). At this stage, when the FO was cross checking the arrival procedure on the Flight Management Guidance Computer (FMGC) he noted that by mistake the captain had selected runway 18L instead of runway 36L and the FO was advised to change the arrival procedure. The conversation between captain and FO at this time indicates that the captain had difficulty in identifying/reading and feeding the correct arrival procedure due to inability in concentration.The FO was continuously found to be prompting the captain for decision making. In order to calculate RVR for their VOR/DME approach runway 36L, the FO calculated RVR as 1800 meters by multiplying visibility (1200m) with 1.5. He lacked the knowledge of RVR calculation procedure and did not consider availability of other services at runway 36L, like high intensity approach lighting system (HIALS) or high intensity runway lights (HIRL). The incorrect calculation of the RVR value was not corrected by the Captain as well. In fact, RVR was the same (1200m) as the reported visibility. The required RVR for carrying out a VOR/DME approach by a Cat C airplane on runway 36L was 1600m.At 09:12, the cockpit crew changed frequencies to Lahore Approach as cleared by Lahore ACC. Lahore Approach found the flight being right of track and inquired if they were right of track. The captain quickly asked the FO to tell Lahore Approach that they were following the RNAV procedure for runway 36L. Further descent instructions were given. At 09:16 Lahore Approach cleared the flight for the RNAV LEMOM ONE CHARLIE arrival runway 36L and, ""descend down to 3000 ft on QNH 1018 hecto pascal and report position ELAMA"". The FO acknowledged the approach by correctly reading back. At 09:20 Lahore Approach observed the flight passing through FL85 at 20 track miles which was approx 2000-2500 ft higher than the assigned altitude. At this time, the cockpit crew selected Flaps-1, 2 and 5 in quick succession in order to increase the rate of descent. Speed brakes were not used. Lahore Approach contacted the flight to reconfirm whether they would be able to make approach or discontinue due to being high.The captain immediately prompted FO to reply by saying ""Affirmative"". At this stage, it is established that the flight was neither following the track (it was right of track) nor the assigned altitudes as per ATC clearance.  The FO then suggested the captain to use the speed brake so that the flight could quickly descend to the desired altitude. The captain in response voiced ""haye...haye...haye"" indicating that he was exhausted and unable to cope  with the situation.At 09:22 the captain asked the FO to lower Flaps-10 and lower the undercarriage. The FO complied with the instructions and confirmed. The captain again voiced ""haye...haye...haye"". At this stage, they also lowered Flaps-15, landing lights on and Flaps-30. The captain asked FO to complete landing checklist which was accomplished successfully.When the flight reported position over ELAMA, the Lahore Approach controller observed the flight to be at 5000 ft altitude instead of already cleared 3000 ft. The duty controller cautioned the flight by telling them that their altitude at ELAMA should have been 3000 ft whereas he had observed it to be 5000 ft. He also advised them to continue at pilot's own responsibility. After passing over ELAMA, the flight turned left heading 355° and lowered Flaps-30. The speed at this time was 180 kts and flight was descending through 5000 ft. At 09:23 the captain disengaged the autopilot at 9NM from RWT to lose the excess height by increasing rate of descent and also executed turns to acquire the runway. However, the captains decision to disengage autopilot at this stage without being visual with the runway increased his workload. Resultantly, the aircraft descended with very high descent rate from 20003500 ft/min. The excessive rate with Flaps-30 selected resulted in exceeding the flap speed limit.By the time the flight reached 4.6 NM from runway threshold, the altitude was almost correct but they were still not visual with the runway. The cockpit crew was actually carrying out a VOR/DME approach instead of the RNAV approach for which the aircraft was not suitably equipped. The captain kept flying the aircraft with no visual cues due poor visibility, increased stress level, loss of situational awareness and reduced mental ability which led to ending up low on approach with high speed. The approach was unstabilized at that point.At 09:24 the captain asked the FO whether the runway was visible. The FO replied in negative and advised the captain to engage the autopilot, which could make runway contact easier. However the autopilot was not engaged.When reported at 4 DME, the controller cleared the flight to land runway 36L. The runway was still not sighted as the airplane was descending through 460 ft AGL. Airspeed at that time was 150 kts, which was 14 knots above the calculated landing speed.Just before the aural alert ""Minimums"" sounded, the FO saw the runway towards the right. The FO also took over the controls and asked the captain to inform ATC that the runway was in sight. The aircraft temporarily levelled off at 400 ft AGL for approximately 7 seconds and simultaneously a right turn was initiated. While descending below 400 ft AGL, the vertical speed kept varying between -1100 ft/min to -180 ft/min. At 200 ft AGL, power was advanced to 55%-65% which increased airspeed and temporarily decreased sink rate. Although the FO picked up visual with the runway at Minimum Descend Altitude (MDA) by chance, the aircraft was not stabilized and a go around should have been initiated instead..At 09:25 the captain also sighted the runway at approximately 150ft and took over the controls from FO. However, the captain was still unable to correctly align the aircraft with the runway, as the aircraft had ended up towards right side of the runway and a left turn was required. The FO was found asking the captain to turn left but the captain advised the FO to 'relax'. After descending through 100 ft AGL, the FO made an effort to take over the controls from the captain in order to land the aircraft. The captain was heard uttering ""Haye...Ok...Haye...Oh..."" indicating total exhaustion and inability to cope up with the situation. The captain was unaware that he was still holding the controls despite handing over to FO. The FO was heard urging the captain to leave the controls. The captain again voiced, ""Haye...Oh"". The FO was busy in landing the aircraft while the captain kept uttering exhausting voices besides being hyperventilated.At 09:26 the aircraft touched down 1400 feet from the threshold, to the left of the centreline. An 8° right bank and 4.5° crab angle caused the right hand main landing gear to touch the runway first. Airspeed was 166 knots, as opposed to the reference speed (Vref) of 134 knots. The speed brakes deployed and the aircraft slightly bounced. The left main gear touched down, followed by the right main gear again. The left main gear then broke after a shimmy. With thrust reversers being deployed, the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway. Upon entering soft soil, the right main gear also broke. The aircraft skidded 8000 feet before coming to rest. An evacuation was carried out.An investigation revealed that the blood alcohol level of the captain was 83 mg/dl (BAC 0.07%). Many countries use a legal limit for drivers of 0.05%. Moreover, the blood lactate level of 70 mg/dl interprets fatigue due to increased stress as the normal level ranges from 4.5 to 23 gm/dl.",09:26,2 CFMI CFM56-3C1,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,NL142,51585,,,,46547,,

This action was intended to speed up the flight, considering the Ende airport operating hours. The aircraft landed in Ende at 16:39.During transit, the captain received a short message from a flight operations officer of Kalstar Aviation in Kupang which informed him that the visibility at Kupang was 1 km. Considering the weather forecast in the Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAFOR) showed that the visibility at Kupang would improve at the time of arrival, the captain decided to depart to Kupang. Another consideration was the operating hours of Ende which would be closed at 17:00.The operating hours of Ende was extended and the aircraft departed Ende at 17:16. Again the captain acted as PM and the SIC acted as PF. There was no departure briefing performed by the PF.After takeoff, the pilot set the Flight Management System (FMS) to fly direct to KPG VOR and climbed to a cruising altitude of FL175.During cruise flight, the pilots monitored communication between the El Tari Tower controller and another pilot. El Tari Tower advised that the visibility at Kupang was 1 km while the minima for approach was 3.9 km. At 17:27, the pilot established communication with El Tari Tower controller and requested for direct to initial approach point SEMAU.At 17:32 the aircraft started to descend to 10,000 feet. When the aircraft passed FL150, the pilot requested to turn left to fly direct to the inbound track of the VOR/DME approach for runway 07 in order to avoid cloud formation which was indicated by magenta color on the aircraft weather radar.At 17:41, the El Tari Tower controller informed that the visibility on runway 07 was 4 km and issued clearance for an RNAV approach to runway 07 and requested that the pilot report when the runway was in sight.Both pilots discussed the plan to make an RNAV approach to runway 07, with landing configuration with flap 5 and auto-brake set to position low. At 17:43, the pilot reported that the runway was in sight when passing 2,500 feet and the El Tari Tower controller informed that the wind was calm and issued a landing clearance.During the approach, the PF noticed that all Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights indicated a white color, which indicated that the aircraft was too high for the approach. Recognizing that the aircraft was too high, the crew performed a non-standard configuration setting by extending the landing gear down first with the intention to increase drag. The landing gear was extended at approximately 7 NM from the runway 07 threshold and afterwards selected the flaps to 1 and 2. The published approach procedure stated that the sequence for establishing landing configuration is by selecting flap 1, flap 2, landing gear down, flap 3 and flap 5.On final approach, the crew noticed the aural warning ""HIGH SPEED HIGH SPEED"". The copilot also noticed that the aircraft speed was about 200 knots, which was about 62 knots higher than the target speed. The pilots decided to continue the approach considering the runway was 2,500 meters long and would be sufficient for the aircraft to stop with the existing conditions. The pilots compared the runway condition at Kupang with the condition at Ende which had 1,650 meter length runway.On short final approach, the aircraft was on the correct glide path and the speed was approximately 205 knots. The PF noticed the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) warning of ""TOO LOW TERRAIN"" activated. The aircraft then touched down at approximately the middle of the runway. After touchdown, the PF immediately applied thrust reversers.Realizing that the aircraft was about to overrun the end of the runway, and with the intention to avoid the approach lights on the end of the runway, the captain turned the aircraft to the right.The aircraft stopped approximately 200 meters from the end of runway 07.",17:46,2 General Electric CF34-10E7,,,,KD676,16862,,,,14765,,

The flight legs to Dwyer Airport were uneventful. At 13:11 the crew started the engines on the apron at Dwyer Airport. Engine no.2 was the last to be started up at 13:47 hours.Before the takeoff the captain distributed the duties within the crew, nominating the first officer as the Pilot Flying, and himself as Pilot Monitoring.After the engine startup the crew initiated taxiing to perform takeoff on runway 23. The concrete runway at Dwyer measured 2439 m by 37 m. In the course of the takeoff preparations, at 13:57:56 the flight mechanic reported an increase in MGT of engine no.3 above the acceptable level: ""Engine 3, look, engine temperature over six hundred, over seven hundred"", which was confirmed by the first officer: ""Yes, its getting temperature"" while the captain asked to be more attentive.The takeoff was performed with Flaps 15. As the checklist was being read, the captain ordered to lock the propellers. After the captain's order to lock the propellers a slight increase in torque values was recorded on engine no.1 and 4, and in 17 seconds also engine no.2. There was no evidence that the propeller of engine no.3 was locked.At 13:59:42 the crew initiated the takeoff. Before the takeoff the ATC advised the crew on the wind direction and speed on the runway: 280° 14 knots (7 m/sec) gusting 26 knots (13 m/sec). Thus it was quartering headwind and the headwind component might have been 5 to 9 m/sec.While performing takeoff the crew first increased thrust on engines no.1 and no.4 and then on engine no.2 after 10 seconds. The thrust of the three engines was about 50 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (lower than takeoff mode). The third engine was still operating in the ground idle mode, though the CVR did not record any crew callouts concerning engine no.3 operation parameters.Based on the CCTV system of Dwyer Airport the takeoff roll was initiated almost from the runway threshold and was conducted to the left of the runway centerline. No significant deviations from the takeoff course during the takeoff roll were recorded. During the takeoff roll the rudder was deflected left close to extreme. Probably the pilots were also applying differential control on engine no.2 to decrease the right torque moment.At 14:00:14 at approximately 120 km/h IAS the ""Engine no.3 negative thrust"" signal started. At that time the aircraft was about 430 m away from the start of the takeoff roll.At 14:00:42 engines no.1 and no.4 thrust was increased up to 63 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (consistent with takeoff mode for the actual flight conditions). At that time the IAS was about 150 km/h. Engine no.2 thrust was increased up to the same value only 23 seconds later at about 200 km/h IAS. At that time the aircraft was about 840 m away from the runway end. Engine no.3was still operating in ground idle mode. Approximately 260 m before the runway end at a speed of 220 km/h IAS (maximum speed reached) nose up input on the control column was started. The aircraft did not lift off. After rolling all along the runway the aircraft overran the runway onto the ground at a speed of 220 km/h.While moving on the ground the aircraft sustained significant damage, which led to a post-crash fire that destroyed most of the aircraft structures. Out of the nine persons on board seven were killed and two were seriously injured and taken to hospital.",14:01,4 Ivchenko AI-20M-6,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,19828,,,,9107,,

The aircraft, an McDonnell Douglas MD-11F cargo plane was bound for Anchorage, Alaska. The aircraft's takeoff weight was 629,600 lbs, which was below the maximum allowable take-off weight of 630,500 lbs. The flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 33L. The aircraft reached V1 speed after a ground run of 6413 feet. About that time the crew heard a noise, originating from the failure of the no.9 tire (the left-hand tire on the central landing gear). The no.10 tire on the same landing gear also ruptured. Vibration and torsion forces then caused the lower drag brace of the central landing gear to break. The drag brace then hit the body several times. This caused a rupture of the hydraulic system of brake system 1, reducing the total brake efficiency to about 48% as the crew rejected the takeoff. With 4,635 feet of runway remaining the aircraft began to decelerate.The aircraft required a deceleration distance of at least about 5,550ft from the position where the takeoff was rejected. As a result, the MD-11 stopped at approximately 1,591 ft (485 m) past the end of the runway 33L. The nose gear collapsed and the no. 1 and 3 engines contacted the grass.The ARAIB investigators noted that there is an inherent difficulty in determining the flight performance of an aircraft after V1 when limited information and little time is available to the crew for a go/no-go decision.The UPS flight operations manual states that after V1, rejecting takeoff is not recommended unless the captain judges that aircraft can not fly, but the manual does not establish a definition of 'non-flying'. ARAIB notes that it would be beneficial for the aviation industry to provide flight crews with definitions of 'non-flightability' and additional guidance and training as to how to judge aircraft flight performance under certain circumstances, especially after V1.",22:43,3 Pratt & Whitney PW4460,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,5X61,63195,,,,11344,,

On board were two cockpit crew members , two augment cockpit crew, five cabin crew, one flight mechanic, and 79 passengers. The departure, en route and descent phases were uneventful. By the time of contacting Khark Island information, weather conditions were reported being CAVOK, wind 300° at 16 knots and flight 4525 has been directed to proceed for a right hand downwind approach to runway 31.When 10 NM out, the crew requested a wind check. Winds were reported from 300 degrees at 10 knots. Having in mind the tailwind limitation of 15 knots as stated in the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) and Operations Manual (OM), the captain judged that a tailwind of 10 knots made it possible to conduct an approach and landing on runway 13. The co-pilot then requested a visual approach to runway 13, which was approved.The cockpit crew then continued for runway 13, configured the aircraft for landing and completed the landing checklist with an approach speed (target speed) of 129 knots and VREF of 119 knots.At 300 feet MSL, first officer noticed airspeed had been accelerating to 145 knots and made a standard callout ""airspeed 145 knots"". Instead of performing a go-around, the captain called out ""Auto Brake Out"", and briefed his first officer about the first portion of go-around procedure.The aircraft crossed the threshold of runway 13 and landed at approximately 685 meters (2,247 feet) beyond the beginning of the runway 13. The available runway length at Khark Airport was 2334 meters.The aircraft failed decelerate sufficiently, in part due to a fault in the anti-skid system and overran onto rough ground.

The commercial pilot and 14 passengers were not injured. No flight plan was filed and local traffic advisory was requested by the pilot. Visual meteorological conditions with light rain showers prevailed throughout the area. The flight originated from Baldwin Airport about 13:50.According to the pilot, he had ferried the airplane from Forest Lake, Wisconsin, to Baldwin on the morning of the accident. The airplane had just completed its 100-hour inspection at Forest Lake. After flying three air drops without incident, he prepared for his fourth flight of the day. He stated that all of the previous 3 flights had successfully deployed the parachutists and were full stop landings in an empty airplane. Due to the temperatures of 90+ degrees and high humidity, the pilot requested his manifests limit to 14 parachutists and allow a longer time between shutdowns to allow for adequate cooling before the next flight. The pilot reported that pop-up rain showers had been passing north and south of Baldwin throughout the morning, but never coming closer than 10-15 miles. While preparing for the fourth flight of the day (accident flight) the pilot discussed the weather with a experienced parachutist. Clouds were currently over the intended drop zone but there was no rain and the clouds were moving away from the northern edge of the drop zone. The pilot and parachutist agreed that it was worth attempting the drop considering the cloud movement away from the drop zone. The 14 parachutists were loaded and the airplane took off. Climbing through 3,000 feet MSL, the pilot checked in with ATC for traffic advisory and a radio check. Climbing through 4,000 feet, ATC advised the pilot that light to moderate precipitation was in the area. The pilot continued to climb toward the drop zone to see if there was any rain over the area and about 1-1.5 miles from the zone, light rain was encountered. The pilot advised the parachutists that they were returning to Baldwin to land because of the weather.After descending, the pilot set up a base leg to runway 18, and about two miles from the airport, turned on final. The approach was a stabilized, powered-on approach which was much flatter than the standard descent with an empty airplane. The pilot used flaps incrementally to 30-degrees (full flaps), initiated a flare over the threshold, and touched down at 65 knots. Full reverse propeller was used and the flaps retracted during the landing rollout. When the pilot started to apply brakes he discovered that the braking action was null. The 1,950 foot-long grass runway was wet because of a recent rain shower. Because of the high temperature, humidity, full load, and trees at the end of the runway, the pilot decided to not attempt a go around. The pilot held full aft on the control yoke for aerodynamic braking, stayed in full propeller reverse, and braked as much as possible without locking the wheels up. Just before coming to a complete stop (about 5-10 mph), the airplane rolled into a ditch before a road beyond the departure end of the runway. The propeller struck the dirt and the tail, causing substantial damage to the empennage. The pilot secured the engine and all of the occupants exited the airplane.",14:00,1 Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-114A,,Repaired,,,10660,,,,,,

The aircraft had been chartered by the University of Michigan Basketball team for a flight to a game in Washington, DC.The flight crew prepared for take-off and calculated V-speeds (V1, VR, V2) using ""Normal Thrust Takeoff"", a 10 kts headwind, and a take-off weight of 146,600 lbs. The V-speeds for this configuration were 139 kts, 142 kts, and 150 kts, respectively. However, the flight crew chose to increase VR to 150 kts to allow for more control during take-off in the presence of windshear.During takeoff roll, at 14:51:56 (about 3,000 ft down the runway) and about 138 kts of airspeed, the control column was pulled back slightly from a non-dimensional value of -7 to -5.52. The airplanes left elevator followed the control input and moved from a position of -15° trailing edge down to -13° trailing edge down. The right elevator did not change and stayed at approximately -16° trailing edge down. At 14:52:01 a large control column input was made (151 kts and 4100 ft down the runway) to a non-dimensional 18.5 and the left elevator moves to a position near 15° trailing edge up. After 14:52:05 the right elevator moves to -13° trailing edge down, but no more. The airplane does not respond in pitch and does not rotate. The captain decided to abort the takeoff.The maximum groundspeed was 163 kts (173 kts airspeed) and the airplane began to decelerate as soon as the brakes were applied at 14:52:08. Spoilers were deployed at 14:52:10 and thrust reversers were deployed between 14:52:13 and 14:52:15. The aircraft could not be stopped on the runway. The airplanes ground speed was 100 kts when it left the paved surface.The aircraft overran the end of the runway, damaged approach lights, went through the perimeter fence and crossed Tyler Road.It came to rest on grassy terrain, 345 meters past the end of the runway, with the rear fuselage across a ditch. The nose landing gear had collapsed. Runway 23L is a 7543 ft long runway.Post-accident examination by the NTSB revealed movement of the control column in the cockpit appeared normal; the control columns were free to move, and the elevator control tabs moved as commanded. However, when investigators tried to move the elevator surfaces by hand, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator was jammed in a trailing edge-down position (airplane nose down). Upon further inspection, the right elevator geared tab inboard pushrod linkage was found damaged which restricted movement of the right elevator surface but allowed movement of the control tab. After the damaged components were removed, the elevator could be moved by hand.Examination of the flight data recorder data indicates that during the taxi and take-off roll, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator did not move. During takeoff roll, the left elevator began a large airplane nose-up movement (consistent with rotation) at an airspeed of about 152 knots and continued for five seconds to about 166 knots. There was no change in the airplane pitch attitude during this time. The airplane data then are consistent with the takeoff being rejected. The maximum recorded airspeed was about 173 knots.Review of previous flight data showed normal movement of both the left and right elevator surfaces.

The following morning the aircraft was prepared for a repositioning flight to Accra, Ghana.Sao Tome Tower initially cleared Cavok Air flight 7087 to taxi on runway 11 as favoured by the prevailing wind. However, the crew requested runway 29 for departure. This request was approved by the controller and the aircraft was re-cleared to taxi to runway 29 for departure. Sao Tome Tower did not provide the flight crew with the information about possible presence of birds at the airport, in particular, on the runway.At 09:05, the aircraft began the take-off roll. The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). The engines and systems parameters were reported to be normal.In the first half of the take-off run the captain noted five to six eagles getting off the ground and flying dangerously close to the aircraft. He then requested the flight engineer to check if the flood lights were ON and to monitor the engine parameters. The crew asserted that they observed a rising and narrowing runway as the aircraft accelerated to a speed of 180 km/hr. At that time the crew noticed a flock of eagles ahead. The captain took control of the aircraft and decided, after assessing the situation within 4 seconds that the best option for the crew was to discontinue the take-off.At that moment, the crew heard a bang, which they suggested could be a bird strike. This was followed by aural and visual indications on the annunciator panel such as ""Left Engine Failure"", ""Dangerous Vibration"", and ""Take-off is prohibited"" and the captain immediately initiated a rejected take-off and instructed the flight engineer to deploy thrust reversers. The rejected take-off was initiated about 5 seconds after sighting the birds, at a speed of 220km/h. According to the captain, his decision was necessitated by the consideration of losing multiple engines due to bird strike if the take-off continued.The captain said he pressed the brake pedals completely immediately after initiating the rejected take-off, subsequently he assessed the braking action as not effective and he used the emergency braking at a speed of about 130 km/h. On realizing that the aircraft would not stop within the remaining available runway length coupled with the presence of a ravine at the end, the captain intentionally veered to the right in order to extend the runway stopping distance and also avoid the ravine. The aircraft exited the runway at a speed of approximately 76 km/h. As the aircrafts speed decayed to 60 km/h and just before the aircraft exited the runway, the captain instructed the flight engineer to close the fuel emergency shutoff cock. The aircraft travelled a distance of about 95m from the exit point before plunging into the ravine. In the process, the forward fuselage separated from the bulkhead located immediately after the cockpit section.The aircraft was destroyed but only one of the six crew members suffered minor injuries.An investigation showed fragments of bird feathers in the engines, belonging to the Common Honey Buzzard.",09:07,2 Lotarev D-36-2A,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,CVK7087,5104,,,,,,

After landing and selecting the speed levers low for taxi, the crew received a crew alerting system warning for the left engine oil pressure. The aircraft was then taxied to the ramp and a normal engine shutdown was performed.The pilot checked the oil level in the left engine and discovered it to be low. A maintenance crew was dispatched to Gods River to inspect and repair the oil pressure issue. After arriving, the maintenance crew added 3 quarts of oil and an inspection of the left engine revealed oil leaking from the engine oil pressure snubber. The aircraft was then parked overnight and arrangements were made to get the parts needed for the repair.The next day, on 1 November 2017, a new maintenance crew arrived with the required parts and replaced the left engine oil pressure snubber. Following a test run of the left engine, there was no evidence of an oil leak and maintenance released the aircraft back to service. During a pre-flight inspection, the aircraft maintenance engineer (AME) noticed a hydraulic fluid leak. The AME checked the hydraulic reservoir and found it to be low. An inspection of the hydraulic system did not reveal the source of the leak and the aircraft was once again parked overnight.On 2 November 2017, another maintenance and flight crew were sent to Gods River to address the hydraulic leak and fly the aircraft back to base. After a lengthy inspection and engine run, the maintenance crew could not identify the source of the hydraulic leak. It was determined that a ferry flight permit would be required to fly the aircraft to a company base at Thompson Airport, for further inspection and repair. The aircraft was then inspected and serviced to the degree necessary for the 50-minute flight. Hydraulic fluid was added to the reservoir, and 1 quart of oil was added to the left engine. The left engine and engine compartment were dry and did not show any signs of an oil leak. A ferry flight permit was then issued that stated the aircraft was to be flown with essential crew only and with the landing gear extended. The flight crew then contacted the assistant chief pilot for a pre-flight briefing that included the risk factors associated with the ferry flight and a discussion about potential emergencies and contingencies, including retracting the landing gear for emergency situations only.At approximately 18:30 on 2 November 2017, the aircraft, operating as Perimeter flight 959, departed Gods River on the ferry flight to Thompson Airport with only the 2 flight crew members on board. Approximately 15 minutes after departure, the crew noticed the left engine oil pressure drop into the yellow band range. The crew then consulted with maintenance operations control in flight and it was decided that if the oil pressure dropped below the yellow band and the oil temperature increased beyond the green band, then the engine was to be shut down.The crew began executing the Preplanned Engine Shutdown checklist in the quick reference handbook (QRH) so that they would be prepared if the left engine indications changed. The crew retracted the landing gear to reduce drag and received a gear up-and-locked indication. Because the oil temperature remained in the green band, the crew paused the checklist at the point where the generators are to be turned off, and continued flying the aircraft with the left engine running. When the aircraft was approximately 40 nautical miles southeast of Thompson Airport, the flight crew told air traffic control (ATC) that they had received a low oil pressure indication on the left engine and that the engine might need to be shut down. No emergency was declared, but aircraft rescue and firefighting services were put on standby.During the final approach to runway 24, the crew extended the landing gear. As the aircraft approached the runway threshold, the left engine rpm dropped to 96%. The pilot then adjusted the right engine rpm to counter the differential rpm. Although the left engine oil pressure dropped below the yellow band, the oil temperature indication did not rise and the crew elected to keep the engine running. It was reported that the left engine oil pressure dropped to 16 psi and the engine oil temperature indication never exceeded 88 °C.The aircraft's initial landing touchdown on runway 24 was on the right main gear, with both engines operating, approximately 1200 feet past the runway threshold. The captain pulled the power levers over the flight idle gate. An engine power surge was heard, and the aircraft began to pitch up and roll to the right. As the upset progressed, the right wing made contact with the runway and the aircraft pivoted around the right wingtip. The nose section then suddenly dropped to the ground and the aircraft came to rest off the runway, approximately 1800 feet past the runway threshold, in an upright position, facing the opposite direction with the engines still running. The engines were shut down using the engine stop and feather control, and the crew exited the aircraft via the left overwing emergency exit. There was no post-impact fire. The occurrence took place at 19:20, during the hours of darkness. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, propellers, landing gear, and right wing.",19:21,2 Garrett TPE331-11U-612G,,,,PAG959,24672,,,,,,

The last wind direction data for runway 29 was transmitted by ATC as 230°/11 knots and QNH 1021. The FO acknowledged the transmission and the crew elected to land on runway 11. The captain stated that the approach for landing was stable and that the touchdown was near the first taxiway exit point. According to the FO, the aircraft floated for a while before touchdown. This was confirmed during the investigation. During the landing rollout, the captain applied the brakes and the brakes responded for a short while, however, the aircraft continued to roll without slowing down. At approximately 300 metres beyond the intersection of runway 35 and runway 11, the PIC requested the FO to apply emergency brakes. The FO applied the emergency brakes gradually and the aircraft continued to roll before the brakes locked and the tyres burst. The aircraft skidded on the main wheels and continued for approximately 180 m until it overshot the runway. The undercarriage went over a ditch of approximately 200 millimetres in depth at the end of the runway into the soft ground and the aircraft came to a stop approximately 10m from the threshold facing slightly left off the extended centre line runway 11. The aircraft was substantially damaged during the impact sequence and none of the occupants sustained injuries.

Initially a Beech 1900 had been scheduled for this flight, but the airline decided to use C6-MIC, an EMB-110 Bandeirante, instead.  A revised flight plan was not submitted to ATC.Weather at the destination, Governor's Harbour Airport, was poor due to heavy rainfall. The pilot in command of the aircraft initially attempted a landing on runway 15 at Governor's Harbour Airport but executed a go-around when visual contact was lost due to heavy rain. On the second attempt for landing, a decision was made to switch to runway 33 and while on final approach to runway 33, visual contact was lost again and a second go-around was executed. On the third attempt the pilot landed on runway 33, but seconds after touchdown there was a collapse of the left main landing gear which subsequently led to a runway excursion taking place.Investigators noticed that the landing gear selector switch was located in the ""UP"" position. Consultation with the operator's maintenance personnel and the aircraft manufacturer has determined, based on the systems operation, that if the landing gear switch is placed in the ""UP"" position and the gear contact micro-switch on either landing gear is contaminated with dirt, water or other contaminants, or if the switch is shorted out for whatever reason, it is possible that the gear may not retract when commanded by the selection of the gear switch. In this instance, it is possible that the gear position lights may still indicate ""3-green lights"" (which normally indicates the gear as being ""down and locked"") despite the gear selector handle being selected to the ""UP"" position. However, once you land or the contaminant is removed or the ""system short"" is corrected, or no longer exists, there is a possibility that the gear could collapse (if the gear selector switch is in the ""UP"" position, as was the case). The AAID believes this to be the case, as no mechanical irregularities have been found or could be replicated that would otherwise explain why the gear collapsed. The AAID also investigated the licensing and record keeping regarding the flight crew. It appeared that the captain of the flight initially had a US FAA license. During his stay in the US, he was convicted and incarcerated for controlled substance violations. As a consequence his FAA commercial pilot license was revoked for life on 11 August 2009.After returning to the Bahamas, he applied for an Airman License Validation based on a (revoked!) Foreign License in June 2011. It is unclear if he received this validation at that time.He was issued a commercial pilot license in May 2013, which was renewed in 2015 and valid until August 2020. The AAID found that no duty time, flight time or sectors were recorded for the captain between a proficiency check was completed on March 2013 and January 9, 2018 (date of the accident). It also appeared that the Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport refused to issue an ID badge to the captain for unescorted access to the restricted airside, citing his US criminal record. Nevertheless he subsequently obtained an ID badge issued by the Grand Bahama Airport Company in Freeport, Grand Bahama. This was not valid for Nassau Airport, yet he managed to gain airside at Nassau without any problems.",19:40,,,Repaired,,978,,,,,,,

The crew immediately switched to manual braking, but to no avail, the aircraft continued the skid until it went off the runway and came to a stop, leaving the right main gear on the runway. The nose landing gear, passing over the less compact shoulder, became bogged down and then broke off. The left main landing gear, with the weight of the aircraft, also dug in so that the left engine touched the ground.The aircraft sustained substantial damage in the area of the nose landing gear cage (wheel well).",12:01,2 CFMI CFM56-3C1,,,,,61721,,,,36555,,

Prior to departure, while in radio contact with Dhaka Ground Control and the airline's Operations department, the captain shows signs that he was agitated and experiencing high levels of stress. As the aircraft was in a climb phase, the captain overheard a communication between Operations and another US-Bangla aircraft regarding the fuel onboard but the captain without verifying whether the message was meant for him or not, engaged in some unnecessary conversation with the Operations staff. The Captain's vocal pitch and language used again indicated that he was very much emotionally disturbed and experiencing high level of stress.The aircraft established its first contact with Kathmandu Control at 07:52 UTC. At 08:07 the First Officer contacted Kathmandu Control and requested descent clearance. Kathmandu Control cleared the flight to descend to FL160 with an estimated approach time of 08:26 which was acknowledged by the First Officer. At 08:10 the flight was handed over to Kathmandu Approach. At 08:11, Kathmandu Approach instructed the aircraft to descend to 13500 feet and hold over GURAS. The crew inserted the HOLD in the Flight Management System.At 08:13 Kathmandu Approach further instructed the aircraft to reduce its speed and descend to 12500 feet. Three minutes later a further descent clearance was given to 11500 feet, and the flight was cleared for a VOR approach to runway 02 maintaining minimum approach speed. Both crew members forgot to cancel the hold on the FMS as they were engaged in some unnecessary conversation.Upon reaching GURAS, the aircraft turned left to enter the holding pattern over GURAS, which was noticed by both crew members and immediately the captain made a correction. At the same time they were alerted by Approach Control. The captain immediately selected a heading of 027° which was just 5° of interception angle to intercept the desired radial of 202° inbound to KTM. The spot wind recorded was westerly at 28kt. The aircraft continued approach on heading mode and crossed radial 202° at 7 DME of KTM VOR. The aircraft then continued on the same heading of 027° and deviated to the right of the final approach course.Having deviated to the right of the final approach path, the aircraft reached about 2-3 NM North east of the KTM VOR and continued to fly further northeast. At 08:27, Kathmandu Tower (TWR) alerted the crew that the landing clearance was given for runway 02 but the aircraft was proceeding towards runway 20. At 08:29, Tower Controller asked the crew of their intention to which the captain replied that they would be landing on runway 02. The aircraft then made an orbit to the right. The Controller instructed the aircraft to join downwind for runway 02 and report when sighting another Buddha Air aircraft which was already on final for runway 02. The aircraft instead of joining downwind leg for runway 02, continued on the orbit to the right on a westerly heading towards Northwest of runway 20. The controller instructed the aircraft to remain clear of runway 20 and continue to hold at the present position as the Buddha Air aircraft was landing on runway 02 (from the opposite side) at that time. After the landing of the Buddha Air aircraft, the Tower Controller, at 08:32 UTC gave a choice to BS211 to land either on runway 20 or 02 but the aircraft again made an orbit to the right, this time northwest of runway 20.While continuing with the turn through a southeastern direction, the captain reported that he had the runway in sight and requested tower for clearance to land. The Tower Controller cleared the aircraft to land but when the aircraft was still turning for the runway it approached very close to the threshold of runway 20 on a westerly heading and not aligned with the runway. At 08:33:27 UTC, spotting the aircraft maneuvering at very close proximity to the ground and not aligned with the runway, the Tower Controller hurriedly cancelled the landing clearance of the aircraft by saying, ""Takeoff clearance cancelled"".Within the next 15-20 seconds, the aircraft pulled up in westerly direction and with very high bank angle turned left and flew over the western area of the domestic apron, continued on a southeasterly heading past the ATC Tower and further continued at a very low height, flew over the domestic southern apron area and finally attempted to align with the runway 20 to land.During this process, while the aircraft was turning inwards and momentarily headed towards the control tower, the tower controllers ducked down out of fear that the aircraft might hit the tower building. Missing the control tower, when the aircraft further turned towards the taxi track aiming for the runway through a right reversal turn, the tower controller made a transmission by saying, ""BS 211, I say again..."". At 08:34 UTC the aircraft touched down 1700 meters down the threshold with a bank angle of about 15 degrees and an angle of about 25 degrees with the runway axis (approximately heading Southeast) and to the left of the center line of runway 20, then veered southeast out of the runway through the inner perimeter fence along the rough down slope and finally stopped about 442 meters southeast from the first touchdown point on the runway. All four crew members (2 cockpit crew and 2 cabin crew) and 45 out of the 67 passengers onboard the aircraft were killed in the accident. Two more passengers succumbed to injury later in hospital during course of treatment. The aircraft caught fire after 6 seconds of touchdown which engulfed major portions of the aircraft.An investigation into the captain's behaviour showed that he had history of depression while serving in the Bangladesh Air Force in 1993 and was removed from active duty after evaluation by a psychiatrist. He was re-evaluated by a psychiatrist in January 2002 and was declared to be fit for flying. Examinations in successive annual medical checks were not focused on his previousmedical condition of depression, possibly because this was not declared in the self-declaration form for annual medicals.During the flight the captain was irritable, tensed, moody, and aggressive at various times. He was smoking during the flight, contrary to company regulations. He also used foul language and abusive words in conversation with the junior female first officer. He was engaged in unnecessary conversation during the approach, at a time when sterile cockpit rules were in force.The captain seemed very unsecure about his future as he had submitted resignation from this company, though only verbally. He said he did not have any job and did not know what he was going to do for living.",14:19,2 Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150A,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,BS211,21419,,,,28649,,

The Boeing 737-800 registered PK-LOO operated on a flight from Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) on this flight. On board the flight were 181 persons, consisted of two pilots, five flight attendants and 174 passengers. The flight departed Makassar at 17:28 local time and cruised at an altitude of FL330. The flight until descent was uneventful.Prior to commencing their descent, the crew received the latest weather information from the Jalaluddin Tower controller: wind calm, visibility 2,500 meters, slight rain, cloud FEW CB (cumulonimbus) 800 feet and overcast 800 feet, temperature 26°C, dew point 24 °C, QNH 1008 hPa and QFE 1006 hPa with additional remarks of CB in the approach area.During the descent, at 18:28, Jalaluddin Tower advised the pilot to descend to 5,800 feet and issued a clearance to carry out a VOR/DME approach to runway 27.At 18:32, the Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that there was rain over the field and requested the aircrafts position. The PM acknowledged the information and reported that the aircraft was on final course runway 27.One minute later a pilot of an ATR aircraft that previously landed informed to JT892 that when they were making the approach, there was heavy rain in the final approach area. The PM acknowledged the information. There was no pilot discussion to anticipate the reported heavy rain.The Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that the wind direction was 150° with velocity of 7 knots, QNH 1008 hPa and issued landing clearance if the pilot was able to see the runway. The PM acknowledged the message and would inform when they were able to see the runway.The pilot requested for high intensity of runway lights and was informed that the runway light had been set to maximum intensity.At 18:34, the PM informed the Jalaluddin Tower controller that the runway was in sight. The Jalaluddin Tower controller then issued landing clearance for JT892 since the controller was able to see the aircraft landing lights.At 18:40, the aircraft touched down, the autobrake operated, the spoiler automatically deployed and the PF selected the engine thrust reversers. The pilots felt that suddenly the rain became very heavy and they were only able to see the runway lights on the left side of the runway. The crew felt an impact and then the aircraft stopped off the left side of the runway at approximately 1,200 meters from the beginning runway 27.The pilot attempted to contact the Jalaluddin Tower controller but this was not received by the controller. The Jalaluddin Tower controller also attempted to contact the pilot, but the pilot did not receive the controllers message.The Jalaluddin Tower controller could not clearly see the aircraft position however, the controller aware that the aircraft experienced an abnormality. The controller notified the Airport rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) using radio because the crash bell had not been connected to the ARFF station since the ARFF station moved to the new location a few months before.All passengers were evacuated using escape slides on the forward cabin doors.",18:35,2 CFMI CFM56-7B24E,,Repaired,,JT892,10661,,,,7960,,

At 12:30, while the aircraft was descending, the pilot contacted the Nice Approach controller and requested authorization to perform an approach via the EM point. The controller contacted the Nice Info controller by phone to inform him of the aircraft's arrival. After this contact, he informed the pilot that there was heavy rain, visibility four kilometers at the destination and asked him what his intentions were. The pilot replied that he was reducing speed to minimum and requested a heading to avoid bad weather.The controller agreed and asked him to contact the Nice Info controller. Nice Info told the pilot to continue as previously cleared and to keep him informed of his intentions. The pilot replied that he would wait for the showers to end at La Môle and then make an approach via the EM point. The controller replied to call him back when he was ready to turn to the EM point and asked him to descend to FL60. A few minutes later, the pilot told the controller that he could not contact the AFIS agent at La Môle and asked him to tell him when the showers had passed. The controller agreed and contacted the La Môle AFIS agent by telephone to ask him to keep him informed of the progress of the showers. Three minutes later, although he had not received any information on the weather evolution, the pilot asked to turn towards the EM point. In the following minutes, the pilot requested several course changes for weather avoidance. After reaching the EM point, the controller cleared him for a visual approach to runway 24 and then asked him to contact the La Môle AFIS agent. The latter indicated that he was alone in the aerodrome circuit, asked him to call back on final approach and gave him the wind conditions (030°, 3 kt). The pilot made a first approach, which he interrupted because he could not see the runway due to clouds. He indicated to the AFIS agent that he was returning to the EM point. The AFIS agent gave him the wind conditions (040°, 4 kt) and asked him to call back on final approach. While the aircraft was heading towards EM , the AFIS agent reported the cloud cover (scattered clouds at 1800 ft). Two minutes later, the pilot asked for visibility on the final approach. The AFIS agent indicated a visibility of 4 to 5 km, before informing him that he had it in sight and giving him the last wind conditions (070°, 3 kt). On the approach the true speed of the plane varied between 145 kt and 150 kt. The aircraft touched the runway 200 m after the threshold of runway, at a true airspeed of 136 kt. The pilot set the flaps to ""full ground"" and the spoilers deployed. The aircraft crossed taxiway B thirteen seconds later, at a true airspeed of 77 kt. It continued onto the paved strip beyond the end of runway 24 and veered left. It left the paved surface at a true airspeed of 41 kts and descended into the river below. The aircraft's nose struck the opposite bank hard. The pilot was able to evacuate the aircraft through the emergency exit located at the rear and right side of the aircraft. It appeared that the landing distance of the aircraft on a wet runway as defined in the AFM performance tables was not compatible with the runway length available at La Môle Airfield. During the preparation of the flight, the pilot used the flight file provided by the operator to determine the landing performance. The landing distance on a wet runway presented in this file increased the landing distance on a dry runway by 15%. However for commercial operations, 60% must be added.Furthermore, on final approach, the aircraft speed was higher than the reference speed on approach and the approach slope was also higher than the nominal slope, which resulted in an increase in landing distance.",13:05,2 Williams International FJ44-3A,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,,,,,,,

The first officer acted as the pilot flying (PF).Weather at Sochi was poor due to the presence of a thunderstorm in the area. After descending to FL90, the pilot contacted Sochi Radar, waited for the weather that met his minimum and was cleared for landing on runway 06.At 02:44:11, when the aircraft was at 850 ft (about 260 m) and at distance of 5000 m from the threshold, the Predictive Windshear System Warning sounded: ""Go around. Windshear ahead"". The crew ignored the wind shear warnings and continued to descend along the glide path. Upon passing the Decision Height of 627 ft (190 m), the PF did not verbalize a decision to continue or go around. The aircraft continued to descend. At 02:45:09, at the altitude of about 170 ft (50 m) and at distance of 850 m from the runway threshold, the ""Windshear, Windshear, Windshear"" alert sounded in the cockpit. At an altitude of about 30 m visibility decreased because of heavy showers. The captain took over the controls and performed a go-around. The workload increased and the first officer forgot to raise the flaps from position 1 to fully up, despite stating this to the captain. Half a minute later he realised his mistake and proceeded to raise the flaps. While complaining about the weather, the crew encountered difficulties in engaging the autopilot but eventually succeeded.Starting 02:49 the aircraft was hastily prepared for the second approach. The captain was now acting as PF for the approach. This time the aircraft was high and fast.At 02:53:49, the controller informed the flight that a preceding aircraft had gone around. The first officer than contact the Tower controller and reported intercepting the glide slope at 600 m, despite the fact that the aircraft had not reached that altitude yet. Sochi Tower cleared the flight for the approach. At 02:54:48, the flight was cleared to land on runway 06.At height of 1050 ft (320 m) at a distance of 6100 m from the runway, the aural warning: ""Go around. Windshear ahead"" sounded, but the approach was continued.The flight crew failed to verbally confirm that the approach was stabilized, with the captain simply stating: ""...to minimum."" In fact the approach was not stabilized given the variation in airspeed.The first officer called out speeds and altitudes continuously in a rather tense voice. During the approach the autopilot and autothrust were engaged.At 02:56:42, at height of about 470 ft (145 m) and distance of 2650 m to the runway, the chime sound and three-time aural warning ""Windshear, Windshear, Windshear"" sounded. However, the crew, in spite of these warnings, continued to descend.At 02:57:13, at height of 75 ft (25 m) and distance of 150 m to the threshold, the captain had disengaged the autopilot and autothrottle, and took manual control. At this time, the aircraft was in the center of the wind shear. Exactly before that, the autothrottle started to reduce the engine rotation speed as the instrument speed to this moment had reached the value of 170 kts. When the autothrottle was disengaged, the throttles remained in this setting. It resulted in the instrument speed increase up to 173 kts. The aircraft passed over the threshold at height of about 54 ft (15 m) and touched down about 1285 m from the threshold at an instrument speed of 160 kts. Right after the aircraft had landed the spoilers were extended automatically and autobrake was initiated. The first officer reported ""Speedbrake up, Reversers maximum"", but the reversers were not yet engaged. The captain noticed this 20 seconds after touchdown and immediately ordered them to be deployed. The engines however were already at ground idle, and when the engines reached maximum reverse mode the aircraft had already overrun the runway.At 02:57:54, 26 seconds after touchdown, the aircraft overran the runway with a ground speed of about 75 kts, broke through the aerodrome fencing and came to rest on a dry and rocky surface in a river bed.

The aircraft was operating a regular flight to Dubai. It was cleared for takeoff from runway 27 at 01:18 local time. As the aircraft accelerated through a speed of 117 knots, the captain's seat recliner mechanism failed. As the captain became unsettled, the throttle levers and control column were moved back inadvertently. He handed over control to the co-pilot for five seconds.After adjusting his seat the captain took control back from the co-pilot and the take off was continued.Both crew members failed to notice drop in engine thrust from 98% to 77%. And since the Auto Throttle was in Throttle Hold mode above 84 kts, the thrust remained at 77%.At 144 knots, some 2000 feet short of the runway end, the captain raised the nose of the aircraft for rotation. he noticed a slower rotation rate and that a higher control column force was required than normal. He increased the control column force aft in order to get airborne. This caused a higher rotation rate and a pitch angle of 10.7 degrees which lead to tail strike on the undulated soft surface past the end of the runway for 17 meters followed by the aft fuselage contacting the localizer antenna and boundary wall. Both main landing gears also impacted the brick boundary wall, causing two holes. The aircraft climbed to FL360 and proceeded towards Dubai because all systems were normal.

The aircraft departed Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, USA at 07:02 UTC (01:02 local time) and arrived near Halifax about 09:00 UTC (05:00 local time). The controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 14.During the approach, the tower controller reported wind from 260° at 16 knots, gusting to 21 and asked the flight if runway 14 was still acceptable. Runway 14 is a 2347m long asphalt runway and the 16 knot wind from 26° would translate to an 8 knot tailwind component. When the aircraft was 1 minute and 21 seconds from the threshold, the crew realized the tailwind component; however, they did not recalculate the performance data to confirm that the landing distance available was still acceptable, likely because of the limited amount of time available before landing. The unexpected tailwind resulted in a greater landing distance required , but this distance did not exceed the length of the runway.After receiving a confirmation from the flight, the controller issued a clearence to land on runway 14.  The aircraft touched down firmly at approximately 05:06, during the hours of darkness. After the firm touchdown, for undetermined reasons, the engine No. 1 thrust lever was moved forward of the idle position, causing the speed brakes to retract and the autobrake system to disengage, increasing the distance required to bring the aircraft to a stop. In addition, the right crab angle (4.5°) on initial touchdown, combined with the crosswind component and asymmetric reverser selection, caused the aircraft to deviate to the right of the runway centreline.During the landing roll, the pilot monitorings attention was focused on the lateral drift and, as a result, the required callouts regarding the position of the deceleration devices were not made.Although manual brake application began 8 seconds after touchdown, maximum braking effort did not occur until 15 seconds later, when the aircraft was 800 feet from the end of the runway. At this position, it was not possible for the aircraft to stop on the runway and, 5 seconds later, the aircraft departed the end of the runway at a speed of 77 knots and came to a stop 270 m (885 feet) past the end.The aircraft struck the approach light stanchions and the localizer antenna array. The No. 2 engine detached from its pylon during the impact sequence and came to rest under the left horizontal stabilizer, causing a fire in the tail section following the impact.

The flight crew comprised the captain (Pilot Flying, PF) and the co-pilot (Pilot Not Flying, PNF). Also, a ground engineer was on board. The purpose was to ferry the aircraft to Savonlinna to restart scheduled flights between Savonlinna and Helsinki-Vantaa. The runway at Savonlinna was cleared from snow but there was packed snow at the edges. Because snow kept falling, the runway condition was considered 'poor', which was reported to the arriving aircraft.At 05:43 the captain reported being established on the ILS localiser. The AFIS officer reported that wind was 220 degrees at five knots and that runway 12 was free. The pilots used 20 degrees flap during the approach. According to the flight data recorder the approach was stable until the threshold. During the final approach the pilots saw the approach and runway lights well. Owing to the icing conditions they intended to use an airspeed which was 10 knots higher than the Aircraft Operations Manuals prescribed minimum approach speed. At the threshold their speed was 126 knots, while the approachs target speed was 120 knots.However, the airspeed at the touchdown zone markings was 123 knots. Contrasting from normal, the aircraft floated close to the surface for 6-7 seconds before touching down. The flight crew did not consider aborting the landing. Following the level flight the captain steered the aircraft toward the ground at a fairly high vertical speed. The aircraft touched down at 05:50, approximately 307 metres after the optimal touchdown point, on the left side of the runway. At touchdown the airspeed was 109 knots, which corresponds to the 110 knot target speed. Judging by the marks on the snow the left main landing gear hit the left snowbank on the uncleared area. The nose gear touched the runway, following which the left main gear became airborne for a moment and the right main gear touched the ground. The left main gear touched down again. After having travelled approximately 100 metres from the first touchdown point the aircrafts nose gear and the right main landing gear moved outside the cleared runway area.The aircraft was tracking towards the left, away from the direction of the runway. The pilots tried to turn the aircraft back towards the runway centreline. According to the markings the aircraft began to turn and started to skid sideways outside the cleared area of the runway.When the left main gear hit a high snowbank outside the runway, the aircraft began to turn more sharply to the left. The left engine stalled when snow entered its air intake. The pilots did not deploy reverse thrust. The right main gear knocked one runway edge light over. The aircraft stopped in half-metre deep snow outside the runway, at a 110 degree angle in relation to runway 12.The accident caused considerable damage to the aircraft. Both of the aircrafts propellers were damaged as well as the nose landing gear.The Safety Investigation Authority stated that this accident demonstrated the fact that the operating licences and air operator licences issued by the EU Member States aviation authorities do not guarantee constant and uniform safety levels among air carriers. While the EUs regulations have aimed at ensuring the most open participation in tendering, they may result in overlooking the safety of aviation as one criterion in tendering. The purchaser organising the public tender for air services will not necessarily impose any safety-associated criteria because of being cautious about breaking EU competition rules and the court processes launched by losing bidders. Often the price and on-time performance are the tender criteria. Purchasers of air services do not have suitable and straightforward indicators to assess air carrier safety. Clients and purchasers may also include those that are not deeply familiar with the aviation branch.",05:50,2 General Electric CT7-9B,,,,MTL650P,,,,,,,

The captain, first officer flight attendant, and 6 passengers on board were not injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage. As the airplane arrived in the Uvalde area, ARTCC cleared the airplane to descend to 4,000 ft. After leveling off at 4,000 ft, the flight crew canceled their IFR clearance and proceeded to the airport visually. The pilot flew over the runway and entered a left downwind visual traffic pattern to see if there were any animals on the runway and what the windsock on the airport indicated. The pilot stated that they did not see the windsock as they passed over the runway. There were no animals on the runway, but the air was turbulent. The flight crew called their downwind and base legs over the airport's common frequency. On base leg, the pilot had the copilot set the flaps to 30°. As the pilot turned the airplane onto the final approach for landing, the copilot lowered the landing gear. The airplane was 4.5 miles from the end of the runway at 2,500 ft agl and an airspeed of 170 kts. The copilot completed the ""Before Landing"" checklist. The pilot confirmed the thrust reversers were armed and called for the flaps to be set to 45°. At 2 miles from the end of the runway, the pilot checked his approach speed and confirmed the landing gear was down.The pilot reported there was turbulence and wind gusts from the hills below and to the west of them. As they passed 50 ft. and coming over the runway, the pilot reduced engine power to idle. The pilot reported they then encountered a windshear. Their airspeed dropped rapidly and the airplane ""was forced down"" to the runway. The pilot unlocked the thrust reversers, applied brakes, and reached to deploy the ground spoilers. As he deployed the thrust reversers, the pilot said it felt like the right landing gear collapsed. He applied full nose-left rudder and left-wing-down aileron, but the airplane continued to veer to the right. The pilot tried using the tiller to steer to the left with no response. The airplane exited the side of the runway and went into the grass.A representative for the airport reported that the airplane on landing hit hard. About two thirds of the way down runway 35, the airplane slid off the right side of the runway.

The airplane came to rest in the shallow waters of St. Johns River, sustaining substantial damage. The 143 passengers and crew survived.The aircraft was engaged in a charter flight to bring military personnel and family members home. The No. 1 (left) thrust reverser was not operational and deferred for the flight in accordance with the airplanes minimum equipment list. The captain was the pilot flying for the accident flight, and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The captain was also performing check airman duties for the first officer who was in the process of completing operating experience training.Flight 293 departed Guantánamo Bay at 23:19 UTC.At 21:22 local time the pilot checked in with a Jacksonville approach (JAX) controller while level at 13,000 ft mean sea level and was provided the JAX altimeter setting; the controller advised the pilot to expect the RNAV runway 28 approach and moderate-to-heavy precipitation on the final approach to runway 28 (9000 ft/2743 m long).At 21:23, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the winds at KNIP were from 350° at 4 knots; the pilot then asked if there was any chance of getting runway 10 because it looked a little better. The JAX controller responded that he was showing moderate-to-heavy precipitation building over runway 10 starting about 5 miles on final. The pilot acknowledged and said he would stick with runway 28.  He was then instructed to descend and maintain 5,000 ft.At 21:25, the controller provided additional weather information to the flight crew, stating that moderate-to-heavy precipitation was present east and west of the airport. The pilot elected to continue for an approach to runway 28.At 21:30, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the flight was heading northbound and the precipitation was moving eastbound; the controller then asked the pilot if he would like to try runway 10 since it might be better. The pilot acknowledged ""yeah go ahead, lets do it."" The controller then instructed the pilot to turn left to a heading of 270°, and the pilot acknowledged.  Over the next several minutes, the flight was vectored for the approach to runway 10. At 21:37, the JAX controller cleared the flight for the RNAV runway 10 approach, and the pilot acknowledged.  Shortly after, the flight was transferred to the KNIP radar controller.The pilot contacted the KNIP radar controller, and, at 21:39, the KNIP radar controller indicated the winds were from 240° at 10 knots; he then cleared the flight to land on runway 10. As the airplane descended through 1,390 ft mean sea level (msl), the pilots configured it for landing with the flaps set at 30° and the landing gear extended; however, the speedbrake handle was not placed in the armed position as specified in the Landing checklist. At an altitude of about 1,100 ft msl and 2.8 nm from the runway, the airplane was slightly above the glidepath, and its airspeed was on target. Over the next minute, the indicated airspeed increased to 170 knots (17 knots above the target approach speed), and groundspeed reached 180 knots, including an estimated 7-knot tailwind.At an altitude of about 680 ft msl and 1.6 nm from the threshold, the airplane deviated further above the 3° glidepath such that the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lights would have appeared to the flight crew as four white lights and would retain that appearance throughout the rest of the approach. Eight seconds before touchdown, multiple enhanced ground proximity warning system alerts announced ""sink rate"" as the airplanes descent rate peaked at 1,580 fpm. The airplane crossed the displaced threshold 120 ft above the runway and 17 knots above the target approach speed, with a groundspeed of 180 knots and a rate of descent about 1,450 ft per minute (fpm). The airplane touched down about 1,580 ft beyond the displaced threshold, which was 80 ft beyond the designated touchdown zone as specified in the operators standard operating procedures (SOP).After touchdown, the captain deployed the No. 2 engine thrust reverser and began braking; he later reported, however, that he did not feel the aircraft decelerate and increased the brake pressure. The speedbrakes deployed about 4 seconds after touchdown, most likely triggered by the movement of the right throttle into the idle reverse thrust detent after main gear tire spinup.The automatic deployment of the speedbrakes was likely delayed by about 3 seconds compared to the automatic deployment that could have been obtained by arming the speedbrakes before landing. The airplane crossed the end of the runway about 55 ft right of the centerline and impacted a seawall 90 ft to the right of the centerline, 9,170 ft beyond the displaced threshold, and 1,164 ft beyond the departure end of runway 10. After the airplane came to rest in St. Johns River, the flight crew began an emergency evacuation.The airplane was mostly intact, but both main landing gear had separated from the airplane and were also located in the river.",21:42,2 CFMI CFM56-7B26,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,LL293,38928,,,,15610,,

Five historic WWII aircraft were on display at Bradley Airport and scenic flights were carried out. The B-17 carried a military livery as ""42-31909"" and named ""Nine O Nine"". The local flight had received clearance for departure from runway 06 at 09:47 hours local time. After takeoff the aircraft made a right-hand turn. At 09:49 the aircraft contacted the Bradley Tower controller and reported an engine no.4 problem (""rough mag"") and asked permission to land on runway 06. This was approved.The controller then instructed the pilot to fly a right downwind leg for runway 6 and confirmed that the flight needed an immediate landing. He subsequently cancelled the approach of another airplane and advised the pilot to proceed however necessary to runway 6. The approach controller instructed the pilot to contact the tower controller, which he did.The tower controller reported that the wind was calm and cleared the flight to land on runway 6. The pilot acknowledged the landing clearance; at that time, the airplane was about 400 ft agl on a midfield right downwind leg for runway 6. The tower controller asked about the airplane's progress to the runway and the pilot replied that they were ""getting there"" and on the right downwind leg. No further communications were received from the accident airplane. The airplane struck approach lights about 1000 ft prior to the runway, then contacted the ground about 500 ft prior to the runway before reaching runway 6. It then veered right off the runway before colliding with vehicles and a deicing fluid tank about 1100 ft right of the center of the runway threshold.The wreckage came to rest upright and the majority of the cabin, cockpit, and right wing were consumed by postimpact fire.An investigation of the wreckage showed that all three propeller blades on the no. 4 engine appeared in the feather position. The no.3 engine had one propeller blade that was near the feather position. The other two blades appeared in a position between low pitch and feather.It was also found that the No. 4 engines left magneto produced a strong spark on the ignition leads for all nine cylinders, but that the grounding tab contacted the housing, causing the magneto to short and not function during a postaccident test. The No. 4 engines right magneto produced no spark on one of the nine ignition leads and a weak and intermittent spark on the other eight ignition leads because of wear to the compensator cam. The shorted-out left magneto would have caused rough engine operation and a partial loss of engine power that would have been exacerbated by the weak right magneto, which is likely what prompted the pilot to shut down the No. 4 engine and return to the airport.With the No. 4 engine shut down, the pilot would have had to use a higher power setting for the No. 3 engine to compensate for the loss of power from the No. 4 engine. Teardown examination of the No. 3 engine revealed evidence of detonation on four of the nine cylinders. In addition, the teardown examination revealed that the spark plugs were worn and had gaps between the electrodes that were beyond the manufacturers specifications. The condition of the spark plugs likely resulted in detonation and a partial loss of engine power that further reduced the total thrust available and exacerbated the thrust asymmetry. The pilot had performed a preflight run-up check of the magnetos at an engine speed of 1,700 rpm, which was higher than the 1,600-rpm speed in the Collings Foundations run-up checklist; after the check, the magnetos appeared to perform normally. However, a B-17 engine ground test checklist included instructions to check the magnetos at an engine speed between 1,900 and 2,000 rpm. If the pilots had been required to perform the magneto check at the higher rpm, they might have detected the detonation on the No. 3 engine and/or the magneto anomalies on the No. 4 engine.",09:53,4 Wright R-1820-97,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,11388,,,,,,

The aircraft stopped 90 meters beyond the paved end of the runway stopway in the middle of a road. All occupants safely evacuated the aircraft.The aircraft took off from Tehran-Mehrabad Airport at 06:24 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL320. The flight was subsequently cleared direct to GODMO. After contacting the controller at Mahshahr the crew was informed: ""runway active is 31; wind is now 280/08kts, CAVOK, temperature +06, DP 04 and QNH 1023, expected VOR approach runway 31 via GODMO 1E Arrival"".The flight responded by requesting runway 13 for landing. ATC then cleared the flight for a VOR/DME approach to runway 13 using the GODMO 1F Arrival procedure.At 07:30:41 local time, the pilot reported over position GODMO at FL100. ATC replied: ""CPN 6936 yes sir; descend as profile to MNM 2000 feet for VOR/DME APP RWY 13, report when leaving IAF and cleared approach.""At 07:32:46, the pilot reported leaving the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) MNM. At that time the aircraft was flying at an altitude at 6647 ft instead of 2000 ft as required.The controller cleared the flight to land. As the aircraft passed 2500 ft, the autopilot was disengaged. Then the captain decided to control altitude and speed by executing an S-turn maneuver several times and continued in visual reference with the ground.At 07:35:29, at altitude 934 ft, the captain asked the copilot to set speed and the copilot called out the target airspeed of 135 knots when the actual speed (IAS) at the time was 196 kt. Upon receiving EGPWS Sink Rate warnings, the copilot warned the pilot to read the landing checklist, but the captain did not accept this and accomplished an unstabilized high-speed approach for the purpose of landing. The copilot claimed in his statement after the accident that: ""I wanted to take control of the aircraft and follow missed approach procedure but due to pilot over-confidence to overcome present situation and age gap, I disregarded it."" The captain was a 64-year old pilot with over 18000 flying hours, compared to the 28-year old copilot who had 300 hours.From 1000 ft until 10 ft altitude, sink rate and pull up warnings sounded in the cockpit successively.Finally, at 07:36:11, the aircraft landed with high speed (171 kt) after passing two-thirds of the runway. It touched down nosegear-first and bounced. Full auto thrust reversers and brakes were applied. The aircraft overran the runway, rolled through a non-paved area and airport perimeter fence, passed a shallow canal then onto an adjacent roadway, where it struck a concrete median strip and a lamp post before coming to a stop.

Of the 8 occupants onboard, the commercial pilot and six adult passengers, along with one infant passenger, were not injured. Day instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and an instrument flight plan was filed. The flight originated from HPB, about 15:58, and was destined for Bethel, Alaska (BET).According to the captain, the weather conditions the day of the accident consisted of snow, low visibility, and flat light. The original flight departure time had been delayed about 3 hours due to weather. The scheduled route of flight was from Bethel (BET), to Scammon Bay (SCM), to HPB, to Chevak (VAK), returning to BET with various passengers and cargo pick-ups and drop-offs along the route. Prior to departure from BET he received runway reports from his dispatcher that all destination airport runways were ready. He also obtained weather at all three destinations. He then did a risk analysis and gathered more weather before deeming the flight conditions good to dispatch the flight.While enroute to HPB he gathered weather for VAK and determined that the VAK portion of the flight would be canceled due to deteriorating weather. Once in HPB he landed without incident on the snow covered runway. He then called Grant dispatch in BET and informed that he would take all the passengers going to BET since he had canceled his flight to VAK; he loaded 7 passengers total and their bags. During the time on the ground, while waiting for passengers, a twin-engine King Air airplane landed and departed the runway with no incident.The pilot then back taxied for a runway 13 departure at HPB. He stated that flat light conditions prevailed, and it was difficult to see down the runway or have any depth perception. He initiated the takeoff with 20 degrees of flap selected and noticed no issues during the initial takeoff roll. He then noticed the airspeed was not increasing fast enough, witnessed the end of the runway approaching, and decided he could not abort the takeoff in time. Committed to the takeoff the airplane became airborne and the stall warning horn activated as the airplane cleared the departure end of the runway. The pilot attempted to get the airplane into ground effect, but the airplane settled, and the main landing gear encountered the snow covered terrain. Subsequently, the airplane's speed decreased, the nose wheel descended and encountered the snow, and the airplane came to rest upright about 150 ft from the end of the runway. All crew and passengers evacuated the airplane, and nobody was injured.The pilot added that the snow on the runway during departure was about 3-5 inches of wet heavy snow.",15:58,1 Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-114A,,Repaired,,,,,,,,,

There were 183 occupants on the aircraft. Three passengers died, the remaining 180 occupants were injured.The aircraft departed Izmir Airport at 17:22 hours. At the time the flight arrived in the vicinity of  Istanbul-Sabiha Gökçen Airport, a thunderstorm was passing. Runway in use was 06. About 18:17 the Tower controller cleared another flight for takeoff from runway 06, reporting wind 300 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 21 knots. The subsequent arrival was flight 2193, which was cleared to land with wind information given as 270 degrees at 22 knots, gusting to 30 knots. This translates to a 19 knot tailwind.Since the wind was shifting the controller reported to a flight on the ground that it was to expect a runway change for departure.At 18:19 Pegasus 2193 touched down, but failed to come to a complete stop on the runway. It overran and went down an embankment, breaking in three. The aircraft came to rest about 30 m below runway elevation.Data from flight tracking website Flightradar24 suggest that the aircraft was steered to the left at the end of the runway, likely as there was an antenna array just past the stopway. The last recorded ground speed was 63 knots as the aircraft crossed the perimeter road.Runway 06 is a concrete runway with a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 3000 m. At the runway end there is a 65 m long stopway, followed by antenna array, perimeter road and a downslope.In March 2020 Turkish media reported on a preliminary report, issued by authorities. According to this report the aircraft was struck by lightning six minutes before landing. During the approach one of the preceding aircraft reported a sudden tailwind of 37 knots below 600 feet. This report was communicated in Turkish by the Tower controller. The Dutch first officer, who was Pilot Monitoring, did not understand this. Subsequent clearances and weather information were in English.After touchdown the speedbrake and autobrake activated. The thrust reversers were selected manually. After passing taxiway F at an airspeed of 57 knots, the speed brake and thrust reverser were switched off. The ground speed was reported to be 84 knots due to the effect of the wind. Six seconds later manual braking was resumed.The aircraft failed to stop on the runway, hit ILS antennas and a small building before it fell 30 m down the embankment.",18:19,2 CFMI CFM56-7B24,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,PC2193,,,,,,,

The pilot flying the aircraft was undergoing route and airstrip training. He was occupying the left seat and was Pilot Under Instruction (PUI). The pilot in the right seat was the instructor pilot for MAF conducting route and airstrip training for the new pilot.The pilot crossed overhead of the airstrip for an inspection of the surface and wind conditions. The crew did not observe any standing water or any wet areas on the strip. They also reported that the windsock indicated calm winds and the strip was clear.The aircraft joined mid-downwind less than half a nautical mile from the airstrip and tracked North West, descending from 1200 ft to 1000 ft before turning onto base. The aircraft began descending as it turned to line up on the final approach profile. There was a tailwind component of 5-12 kt on base and final. The aircraft overshot the turn onto final approach, 1.8 nm from the threshold at 900 ft. The pilot established the aircraft on the approach profile 1 nm from the threshold and at about 500 ft.The instructor stated that during final approach, the aircraft had descended below the normal approach profile causing him to instruct the pilot to adjust power and aim point to get back onto the correct profile.The pilot commenced the flare just under 20 ft AGL, 78 kt (85 kt ground speed).The aircraft touched down with an airspeed of 77 kt (82 kt ground speed) 36 m past the runway 11 threshold. The pilot stated that a few seconds after touchdown, he applied reverse thrust and the aircraft veered left. According to tyre track approximations, the aircraft appeared to have deviated about 220 m up-strip from threshold. The pilot stated that he applied full right rudder in an attempt to turn the aircraft back towards the center of the strip. The aircraft turned back to the right and rolled parallel to the centerline for another 100 m before it swerved left again, diverging at a 30° angle from the centerline. It rolled for 60 m as it bogged into the soft ground. The propeller blades subsequently struck the ground and the aircraft turned sharply left causing it to tip onto its starboard side.The crew reported that there were no injuries sustained during the accident and subsequent evacuation.",14:48,1 Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-114A,,Repaired,,,566,,,,1069,,

The pilot sustained no injury. The flight departed the Corpus Christi International Airport (CRP), Texas, at 20:04 with 631 lbs of cargo and a fuel load of 2,800 lbs. During the initial climb, the captain selected the landing gear handle to the UP position to retract the landing gear. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the captain attempted to cycle the landing gear handle once more yielding the same result. Following the second unsuccessful gear retraction, the captain elected to leave the landing gear handle in the DOWN position and continued to the San Antonio International Airport (SAT), Texas, where more services would be available if needed. The airplane climbed to 8,000 ft mean sea level and cruised below the maximum landing gear extended speed (VLE).As the captain began to prepare for arrival at SAT, he retrieved the arrival automatic terminal information service (ATIS). The ATIS was reporting gusting winds out of the north, clear skies, and runway 4 as the active arrival runway. The captain began the descent toward the airport and air traffic control cleared the airplane for the visual approach to runway 4. The pilot entered a dogleg right base and completed the before landing checklist noting three green lights and no red lights, which indicated the landing gear was down, locked, and safe for landing.The airplane touched down around the aiming point marker on runway 4. As the main landing gear touched down on the dry concrete, the left main landing gear collapsed, the red unsafe light in the landing gear handle illuminated, and was followed by an aural horn indicating the landing gear was now unlocked and unsafe for landing. Simultaneously, the airplane began to dip toward the left, causing the left wing tip to contact the runway. The impact on the airplane resulted in the airplane's momentum taking the airplane from the runway centerline off the runway and into the grass area several thousand ft from the runway 4 threshold. Once the airplane came to a complete stop, the captain shutdown all power to the airplane and exited through the main entry air stairs.The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.A postaccident damage assessment by the operator revealed that the left main landing gear brace was fractured.",20:50,2 Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65B,,,,1829,,,,,,,

After cruising for approximately 59 minutes, the aircraft began its descent into Camp Taji, Iraq. During descent, the crew leveled off at 3700 feet mean sea level (MSL) and reduced throttles to flight idle. The copilot slowed and configured the aircraft for a night vision device (NVD) approach and landing with flaps set to 100 percent. The aircraft's highest recorded airspeed during this approach was 157 Knots Indicated Air Speed (KIAS), although the maximum recommended airspeed with the wing flaps set to 100 percent is 145 KIAS. At approximately two nautical miles (NM) from the airfield, the aircraft was 1000 feet above the recommended glideslope for runway 34 and at 150 KIAS, and remained above glideslope until landing. The reported tailwind for runway 34 at Camp Taji was 10 knots, with a temperature of 34 degrees Celsius. The aircraft crossed the runway 34 threshold at a ground speed of 161 knots (151 KIAS); the recommended calculated landing velocity for the aircraft at its weight (122,000 pounds) was 105 KIAS.The crew attempted to land the aircraft at higher than optimal speed with a nose-down attitude. The aircraft's excessive air speed continued to generate lift on the aircraft and caused it to porpoise upon touchdown, which prevented the aircraft's braking system from engaging due to a lack of proper weight on the wheels. Thirteen seconds after touchdown -eight seconds of which were spentporpoising- the aircraft began to slow as expected, once the engines were placed in reverse and when the wheels then received adequate weight to engage the anti-skid brakes. However, by that point there was insufficient runway remaining (less than 1000 feet) and the aircraft departed the prepared surface, whereupon it came to a stop only when it struck a 12-foot-high concrete barrier approximately 600 feet past the end of the runway, at approximately 22:05 local time. All 26 individuals onboard the aircraft survived the mishap and egressed, with only relatively minor injuries to two individuals.",22:05,4 Allison T56-A-15A,,Written off (damaged beyond repair),,,,,,,,,

The two pilots on board were not injured.The flight crew briefed and set up for the instrument landing system approach (ILS) to runway 18, expecting to break out of the overcast cloud layer and execute a visual approach to runway 36 due to more favorable winds. Upon exiting the overcast the captain activated the airports pilot controlled lighting system and the first officer saw the runway. Both pilots believed the runway that they saw was runway 36. They maneuvered the airplane visually toward the runway that was in-sight and executed a landing. Upon touchdown it became clear that they had inadvertently landed on runway 32, which they new was closed. The airplane struck a snow berm at the edge of the intersection with runway 36, the landing gear broke from the airplane and the airplane slid to a stop. The airplane sustained damage to the landing gear, lower fuselage, wings and ventral strakes.The runway had been closed due to the large amount of snow. The runway was covered with about 4 inches of snow that had yet to be cleared. The airport manager noted that the runway lights were on due to the snowplow operations that were taking place as an aid in determining the location of the runway edge.

The pilot was the only person on board the aircraft and this flight was the second flight of the day for the pilot and the aircraft. Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction.Considering that the aircraft altitude was higher than normal for the landing approach to runway 09 at Angguruk and attempting to avoid clouds, the pilot made several maneuvers over Angguruk. During that maneuver, the pilot noticed that the grass on the runway, about 50 meters from beginning of the runway 09 and the grass about 30 meters before the threshold of runway 09 had brighter color than the other grass. The pilot thought that the brighter color-grass was the grass that had been cut.When on final approach, the pilot noticed that the runway threshold markers were visible. The pilot recalled that the markers did not stand out as usual due to the color. The pilot also recalled that the area about 30 meters before the threshold runway 09 looked usable for landing, as the color was no different with the 50 meters of the beginning runway. The pilot planned to make touchdown in the very beginning of runway 09 as he did not want to use more braking to decelerate the aircraft.The aircraft touched down about 22 meters before the runway threshold, then veered to the left and stopped about 112 meters from the beginning runway 09 on heading 182°.No one injured in this occurrence and the aircraft was substantially damaged.",,1 Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-114A,,Repaired,,,11388,,,,21114,,
